Pretoria - Visible patrolling, reinforcing perimeter fences and installing boom gates at all entrances are just some of the measures to be implemented as security is tightened in the Klapperkop precinct.These and other measures will be the main focus of a high-level security cluster, planned by stakeholders and other affected parties,to curb the escalating rate of crime.They met last week to discuss crime and to come up with safety measures at the nature reserve.On Wednesday DA ward 59 councillor Shaun Wilkinson said it was important for everyone to note that plans to make the precinct safe again were in progress.The spate of muggings of cyclists, joggers and tourists in the Fort Klapperkop area has rendered it dangerous since the start of the year.Wilkinson said there were talks to have constant patrolling of the precinct. We have contacted ADT, Hi-Risk Security and Interactive Security to forge together a policing force to increase the precinct's security dramatically, he said.The plan, involving various stakeholders, active citizens and the Friends of Groenkloof, would ensure safety, he said. The plan is supported by mayor Solly Msimanga and it is to ensure people continue to have freedom of movement within the reserve, Wilkinson said.The need for heightened security follows a spate of attacks against reserve visitors, mostly held up at knifepoint. Nine incidents occurred within the first two weeks of this year.The situation had reached crisis point, according to Robrecht Tryhou, chairman of the Friends of Groenkloof Nature Reserve, who started a Facebook page to document people's concerns.A group of dangerous criminals who are heavily armed are carrying out muggings, bag snatching and housebreaking in Klapperkop and surrounds. The criminals' favourite hotspots were the viewing points, where unsuspecting visitors were caught off guard while enjoying the view.During a tour of the targeted areas on Wednesday, the Pretoria News was shown the entrances where evidence of the boom gates being installed was already visible.These were the eastern and western entrances, where Wendy houses will be erected for security guards.Also part of the security features will be metal structures next to the Wendy houses. Chemical toilets and a water tank will be installed there for the security guards to use. This will prevent the need to be away from their stations when they take toilet breaks.MMC for agriculture and environment, Mike Mkhari, said a solid partnership existed between the city and the Friends of Groenkloof, that had raised R60 000 for the installation of the boom gates and Wendy houses.The city will announce a financial pledge during an assessment budget meeting scheduled for February 24.An amount will go towards beefing up the precinct s security.The previous city administration had pledged R450 000 towards security in the precinct. It was announced during a public meeting spearheaded by then MMC for economic development Subesh Pillay. But it is alleged that the change of administration deterred the handover.Active community member and cyclist Rob King said he felt positive after the recent developments and progress. The aim is to have controlled access because patrolling the reserve is not easy, he said. [email&#160;protected]Pretoria News
