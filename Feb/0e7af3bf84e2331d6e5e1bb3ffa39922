Pretoria The problems of former controversial personal injury lawyer Ronald Bobroff and his son Darren, who fled to Australia, are escalating.Tony Beamish, a seasoned journalist, and four lawyers are suing the disgraced family for nearly R24 million in damages for defamation. Also included in the lawsuit is Darren s wife Lisa and his elderly mother and wife of Ronald, Elaine.The claim is lodged at the Gauteng High Court, Joburg, by journalist at Carte Blanche Beamish, former Law Society of the Northern Provinces head Anthony Millar, former partner of Ronald Bobroff Stephen Bezuidenhout, as well as lawyers Norman Berger and Rael Zimerman.The lawsuit followed about 144 instances of alleged defamation levelled by Bobroff family members against the five plaintiffs. The public rants were mainly on Twitter and Facebook and via websites set up by the Bobroffs.Darren especially, publicly displayed his feelings towards some of the plaintiffs and was even captured on camera showing the middle finger to one of them outside court.Beamish is one of the journalists who exposed the Bobroff s dealings in overcharging clients.The alleged smear campaign against Beamish and the others gained momentum after it was established that the Bobroffs overcharged clients with whom they had entered into contingency fee agreements.Various courts declared these agreements illegal and the firm was ordered to refund those who were left out of pocket. The amounts run into millions. It is not yet clear whether the Bobroffs will defend the action.Pretoria News
