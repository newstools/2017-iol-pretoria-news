Pretoria Christinah Mabena has had constant headaches and severe body pains after the beating she got in November when the son of her employer hit her with a golf club so hard that she ended up in the intensive care unit.The 53-year-old domestic worker spoke on Thursday after the 28-year-old accused failed to appear before the magistrate in Pretoria North. The court was told his psychiatric evaluation, as ordered by the court, had started.During his appearance last month, the magistrate ordered that he be referred to Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital.The case has now been postponed to March 2, when the evaluation report is due to be presented.Mabena worked as a domestic worker in Montana. She was on duty at a house where she had worked for many years on the day of the attack. She said the man hit her with a golf stick on the head when she tried to take back her cellphone, taken by him without her permission.She sustained serious injuries to her face and the back of her head, and also had broken ribs.Mabena was rushed to the Steve Biko Academic Hospital where she received a number of stitches around her left eye and spent three days in the ICU.Pretoria News
