Pretoria - A case of common assault has been opened at the Brooklyn Police Station by a pregnant student from the Pretoria of University who was allegedly attacked on campus by private security guards. The attack allegedly occurred on Monday evening due to issues relating to shortages of student accommodation at the university. Police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach confirmed that a case had been opened on February 14 by the student after a security guard allegedly slapped her. Weilbach said a group of students were apparently still on campus just before midnight when campus and private security asked them to leave. The students alleged that the security guards pushed them around and at one of the gates, some of the students retaliated by throwing stones at the guards. University spokesperson Candice Jooste said they had been made aware of the matter and they were now able to investigate the matter internally. Jooste said UP condemned all types of violence against students and staff. The case will be taken to the Hatfield Community Court for a decision after the investigation is completed, said Weilbach.
