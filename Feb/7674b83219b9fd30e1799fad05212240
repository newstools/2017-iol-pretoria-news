Pretoria The SAPS held a research colloquium at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Centre in search of innovative and improved ways of enhancing policing.The research colloquium is one of the exploratory research activities included in the research proposal for the development of an ideal and suitable policing model for the SAPS.The colloquium was also aimed at co-operating and obtaining expertise in all areas of policing, including technology, research, procurement and skills development. In addition it also served the purpose of introducing the newly established SAPS Research Division and the SAPS Research Agenda for 2016 to 2020 to all participants.The three-day colloquium included participation from SAPS members from national and provincial levels, universities, research organisations, NGOs, SAPS business partners and prominent social activists in the field of policing and community safety as well as community policing forums. The debates were explorative and extensive and fruitful exchanges were made between all role players which contributed significantly towards the development of a suitable policing model for the SAPS.Lieutenant-General Gary Kruser said the SAPS was working industriously towards creating a safe country, hence it was deemed necessary to establish a research division.Describing the event as successful beyond his expectations Kruser said: We police in a complex and fluid environment, with various strategies and policies in place. We need to continuously assess what is relevant, which areas need development and use research to better serve our communities .Kruser is the deputy national commissioner responsible for national management intervention and the newly established research division is located within that environment. It will not only be beneficial to the SAPS but will assist research institutions and independent researchers to understand how they can contribute towards an enhanced policing body of knowledge and research in policing in the South African context.Divisional commissioner, research; Lieutenant-General Bongiwe Zulu said the significance of developing a research agenda was to meet the changing demands in policing, and to respond to current development trends, policy concerns and academic debates on policing. The SAPS Research Agenda has been completed at the crucial moments of the analysis and implementation of the National Development Plan vision for 2030, said Zulu.Two experts, who attended the research colloquium, Nompumelelo Radebe from the National Treasury and Dr Vusi Sithole from the Department of Transport, thanked the SAPS for this initiative which was well received by all delegates. Policing is a community matter; those participating in this colloquium represent a pool of knowledge on policing and it was a good exercise for the SAPS to invite such people, said Sithole. Research on an ideal model of policing in South Africa is a process which started with round table discussions, progressed to holding this research colloquium and will result in a research report after all information gathered has been processed and analysed, said Zulu.The SAPS will make the research report available once finalised.Pretoria News
