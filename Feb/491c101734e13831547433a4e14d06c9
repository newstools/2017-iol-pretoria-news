We really wanted to add something fun and exciting for the whole family at Menlyn Park, said Olive Ndebele, the general manager of the shopping centre. Santa s workshop entertained the kids, the craft workshop catered to creative shoppers, and the luxe pop-up provided all the pampering shoppers needed.The Smile Foundation was the perfect choice for Menlyn Park to partner with. The NGO helps children in need of surgery for treatable facial anomalies. They are currently based in eight academic hospitals around South Africa.The Smile Foundation invests in the medical teams it works with through an academic skills programme, and assists the hospitals by purchasing equipment for use by the departments of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The Smile Foundation is so grateful for this donation. The proceeds will certainly be used to continue giving children hope, said radio DJ Sam Cowen, an ambassador for the foundation.
