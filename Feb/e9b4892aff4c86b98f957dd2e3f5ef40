Pretoria The families of over 94 deceased psychiatric patients transferred from Life Esidimeni Health Care Centre into NGOs around the province have asked for privacy as they embark on a healing session.The private session organised by the Gauteng provincial government will be held on Saturday morning at Freedom Park. The aim is to provide a platform for families to reflect on what has happened and share with one another their experiences. Provincial government spokesperson Thabo Masebe said the request for the healing session was made to Gauteng Premier David Makhura during a meeting with the families in December. &quot;The families have requested that the session should be kept private and not open to the media.&quot; &quot;Its is their session and we will give them what they wish. Our only involvement is assisting them with the venue and logistics such as transport and food,&quot; he said. Masebe said Makhura, Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi and MECs would be attending the session but would only take part as determined by the families. The Department of Health and medical experts are working to find the right institutions to house the 700 patients who remain at 22 NGOs. Motsoaledi said all NGOs would be shut down as recommended by Makgoba, but the department would not rush to move patients out of NGOs to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had led to patient deaths. Makgoba has given the health department 45 days to apply his recommendations. Following assessment by health department staff seven NGOs have already been closed. Life Healthcare said one of its Esidimeni facilities could take 75 patients in the next week and would need eight weeks to get ready to take more. [email&#160;protected] Pretoria News
