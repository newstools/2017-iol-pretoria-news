* Article has been updatedPretoria The #UPResCrisis hashtag filled the twitter sphere on Monday evening and on Tuesday morning about black students allegedly being kicked out in the middle of the night by the University of Pretoria s security personnel.Numerous tweets chastised UP for allegedly giving preference to white students who were financially better off and leaving students from disadvantaged backgrounds to contend with expensive private accommodation.Rikus Delport, Tuks spokesperson, said the tweets were from people who were trying to create an issue where there was none. &quot;It is not true. All students were offered accommodation last night and they refused. They then went into the toilet and pretended to be sleeping there while taking pictures which they posted on social media,&quot; Delport added.User @Dee_DimpleZ tweeted: &quot;Every year students must display their struggles for yall to take them seriously neh @UPTuks? #UPResCrisis.&quot; &quot;Students from Waterkloof with cars are placed in res while students from as far as Malamulele in Limpopo are homeless on campus, #UPResCrisis,&quot; wrote @Thabelang07. &quot;Hearing female screams from campus now I'm panicking yini kwenzaka ntoni ni right guys eish how can I sleep after that #UPResCrisis,&quot; said @AfriqueSandy.
