She went to check to find the wall had caved in against her kitchen wall. After I heard the sound, I rushed to the door and tried to open it, but it was stuck, she said.Ndhlovu opened her window to establish where the sound came from and saw the collapsed wall. I called my neighbours for help. I feared for my life when I saw the collapsed wall. But no one came to rescue me, she said.What made Ndhlovu sad was how the neighbours ignored her and left her to deal with the ordeal by herself. She called police and was referred to Tshwane Emergency Services who responded after an hour. I was trapped and could not get out until the emergency services guys came all along I was freaking out, thinking the collapsed wall might have shaken the foundation of my house.
