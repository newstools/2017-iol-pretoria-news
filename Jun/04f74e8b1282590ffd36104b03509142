Cape Town – Speaker Baleka Mbete has indicated she did not have a problem to effect the ruling of the Constitutional Court by allowing a secret ballot in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. Spokesman for Parliament Moloto Mothapo said on Thursday the Speaker will implement the court decision. The response by Mbete comes a few hours after the Constitutional Court gave its ruling on the application by the UDM to force her to conduct a secret ballot. The UDM and other parties had said in court this would prevent ANC MPs who could be exposed to threats and intimidation. Mothapo said Mbete did not have a problem to allow a secret ballot. “Now that the court has clarified that the Speaker has the powers under the Constitution to conduct motions of no confidence by way of a secret ballot, she will, accordingly, ensure the judgment is given effect,” said Mothapo. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said in the judgment Mbete had Constitutional powers to allow for a secret ballot. Political Bureau
