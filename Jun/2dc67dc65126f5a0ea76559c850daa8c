Mumbai - BP and Reliance Industries will invest
as much as $6 billion to restart work in Indian oil and gas blocks after eight
years, in an area off the South Asian country’s east coast where both companies
have faced trouble boosting production. The companies aim to develop about 3 trillion cubic feet of
resources that will result in production of an additional 30 million to 35
million metric standard cubic meters a day of gas from the D6 block in the
Krishna Godavari basin between 2020 and 2022, Bob Dudley, chief executive
officer of BP said in New Delhi. Read also: R9bn to fund Life Healthcare purchases The companies will first award contracts for work in the

government before the end of 2017, he said. Bloomberg
