They are actually taking the keys from the truck drivers,” said Nxumalo.She said earlier, in a bid to scare motorists around the Mall of Africa in Midrand, some taxi drivers had fired shots in the air.

Remember, we have alternative routes like the R101 and some people had used such roads to get to their destinations. Our officers rushed there and we are on the scene. We are still looking for that taxi, obviously it has firearms,” said Nxumalo.She appealed to road users to venture onto the roads only after ascertaining whether it was safe.“I cannot say people should not go to work, but they must use alternative routes, not the major freeways.” The Tshwane Metro Police on Wednesday said the protest was illegal. The taxi operators, aligned to the South African National Taxi Council, are protesting against what they call high repayment fees on their vehicles.The Gauteng operators had on Wednesday advised commuters to arrange alternative transport for Thursday.However, commuters in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria, said though they had managed to organise other means of getting to work on Thursday, they were blocked by taxi operators on the exit of the area.“I usually use a taxi but because of the strike I decide to take a bus. Some people arranged private cars, unfortunately we were blocked on the exit and told to go back home,” said resident Phillip Moremi.The area remained quiet and there was no reports of violence.Taxi operators were expected to hand over a memorandum of grievances to the directors of SA Taxi Finance company.
