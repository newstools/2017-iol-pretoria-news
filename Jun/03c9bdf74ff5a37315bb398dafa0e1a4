And thanks to the South African Rugby Union (Saru), we are giving readers the chance to be in the stands for the game. In addition, one reader will win the new Springbok jersey. It has been seven years since Les Bleus graced our shores, with their last visit ending in defeat at the hands of the Boks in Cape Town. The Springboks are keen for a win as their loss to Wales at the end of last year hurt, and this will be their first international this year. South Africa will be led by Warren Whiteley, who became a father to Samuel Henry this week, called from a training camp to be by his wife Felicity’s side. This is the couple’s second baby after Ava Grace was born in 2015. Springbok coach Allister Coetzee has cast his net wide in terms of debutants with Andries Coetzee, Ross Cronje, Dillyn Leyds, Raymond Rhule, Courtnall Skosan, Ruan Dreyer and Lizo Gqoboka all in line to earn their first international cap. The two nations have met 39 times, with South Africa winning on 22 occasions, losing 11 and drawing six times.
