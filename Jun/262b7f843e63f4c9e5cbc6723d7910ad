On Tuesday night, Makhubela was overwhelmingly endorsed by at least 120 regional branches to take over from Gauteng chairperson Lebogang Maile, who is also the MEC for Economic Development. Regional secretary Ratshi Mashamba confirmed that Makhubela was unanimously nominated by branches to become the next provincial chairperson. Makhubela was among candidates in the running for the national ANC Youth League presidency in 2015 in the contest against Collins Maine. However, he declined the nomination at the congress and Maine was elected as the league president. Mashamba said: “We need Makhubela to re-energise the ANC Youth League in the province, and the agenda of youth development. We think he is a militant and radical leader.” Asked about whether the region had already lobbied other provincial regions to support Makhubela, he said: “We are going to allow other regions to sit and resolve on the nominations.” The Pretoria News understands that Tshwane stood the chance of influencing the congress outcome as it would be taking the biggest delegation, more than those from Ekurhuleni, Sedibeng, West Rand and Joburg. There have been allegations that Makhubela wanted to backstab his deputy Ezra Letsoalo by campaigning that he be replaced by a candidate from Hammanskraal. According to sources, Makhubela’s move would be to exchange favours with the regional deputy secretary, George Matjila, who used not to see eye to eye with the youth league. Matjila, who is from Hammanskraal, has since smoked the peace pipe with Makhubela and the league. Mashamba disputed allegations that Makhubela wanted to have a say on who should succeed him. He said: “The working relations in the Greater Tshwane region have improved. There is no move to block the deputy chairperson from becoming the next chairperson.” According to Mashamba, the regional congress is set to take place within few weeks.
