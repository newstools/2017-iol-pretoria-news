Today will see the case reopening before Judge Billy Mothle at the Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg. The inquest comes 45 years following the 30-year-old's death in police detention after he fell 10 stories from a window at the notorious John Vorster Square Police Station, now called Johannesburg Central. “We support the Timol family’s bringing forward of new evidence to support the view their son was killed  and that the magistrate who ruled that his death was a suicide had erred,” said executive director of the Foundation, Neeshan Balton.
