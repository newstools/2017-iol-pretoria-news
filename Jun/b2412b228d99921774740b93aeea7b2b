GOITSEMANG TLHABYE[email&#160;protected] Although she was never verified, the world and South Africa's oldest person Johanna Rametsi from Stinkwater, Hammanskraal is finally healed and with her God.Rametsi died at the age of 134 at her home on May 31. Neighbours, friends, community members, ANCWL members and police representatives came in their numbers to honour Rametsi during a memorial service held at her home. Rametsi passed away 25 days after she was handed over her newly refurbished home on May 6. SAPS Captain Sarah Lesabane said she was relieved that Rametsi had been spared the recent murders, break-ins and domestic abuse that had gripped the community. Lesabane urged community members to unite behind Rametsi's memory and work together in order to reach a ripe old age. &quot;Let us know our neighbours and talk to one another. We are killed by our children in this community. But together we will reach such a gracious age.&quot; Caretaker Jeanette Ntimbane said although she was saddened by Rametsi's passing she was comforted by the words of her favourite song; &quot;Ke na le modisa&quot; (I am with God). &quot;I will always remember how much she would plead with me not to cook cabbage as she hated it. All she wanted was meat, chips and a glass of coke.&quot; She was my grandmother, my child, my teacher and everything to me. So although I am hurt that she is no longer with us today I want to celebrate her long life as she would have wanted. Rametsi born on January 1 1883 in Krugersdorp is survived by 16 children, 78 grandchildren and 247 great-grandchildren.&nbsp;Her funeral service will be held at her home in Hammanskraal on Sunday.
