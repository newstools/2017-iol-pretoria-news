Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the arrest of the man for an incident last month uncovered a record of unsolved car theft by the 37-year-old man from Mamelodi. He had been out on parole for, among others, motor vehicle-related crime. “He was released in December last year after serving sentences for drugs and motor-vehicle related offences,” Mavimbela said. The man was due to be released from parole at the end of 2021, but that has become unlikely with the alleged crimes he has since accumulated. He said the recent charges against the suspect emanated from an alleged attempted hijacking of a Range Rover in Sunnyside. “A few minutes after the attempt was reported to the police, they caught the suspect driving in a Toyota Corolla, believed to be the getaway car used after the attempted hijacking.” Mavimbela said inside the Corolla they found car keys compatible to the Range Rover. Further investigations revealed that the Toyota Corolla was taken by force from the owner in Garsfontein about a month earlier. The police found that bank cards recovered from the Toyota Corolla belonged to a man whose Mercedes-Benz AMG was forcefully taken in Sunnyside two days before the suspect was arrested. Pretoria News
