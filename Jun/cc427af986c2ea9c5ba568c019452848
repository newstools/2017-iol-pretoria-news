The Public Protector yesterday released a report on the Alleged Failure to Recover "Misappropriated Funds" in the erstwhile Bankorp lifeboat investigation. The public protector ordered remedial action directing Parliament to effect a constitutional amendment to the Reserve Bankâ€™s powers. This had an immediate and negative impact on the markets and the exchange rate of the Rand.

The SARB believes that the remedial action proposed will have a negative impact on the independence of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful. The Reserve Bank has been advised to bring urgent review proceedings to have the remedial action set aside. The Reserve Bank has resolved to do so. The Reserve Bank has also indicated that it will address its other concerns with the report and evidential factual inaccuracies therein, at the appropriate time.
