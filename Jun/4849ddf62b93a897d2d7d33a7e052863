ZELDA VENTER[email&#160;protected]&nbsp;A COUPLE from Meyersdale in Johannesburg nearly lost their home as the bank with whom they held a mortgage bond agreement, insisted that they pay back the entire outstanding bond as they were two weeks late on their payment. Nedbank turned to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, where they claimed the payment of more than R2.5-m from Terrance and Sylvia Mbambo. This was the outstanding amount of the bond at the time when the couple fell in arrears for only two weeks. The bank at first also wanted the court to order that the property was executable and sold so that it could recover the outstanding bond balance. It, however, abandoned this demand when the matter was argued in court. But the bank still insisted that the couple had to pay the full outstanding total of their bond debt - R2.5-million, even though their R28 000 monthly installment was only two weeks late and fully paid by the time summons were served against them. Judge DS Molefe not only turned down Nedbank s claim against the couple, but he also slapped the bank with the legal costs. The judge referred to a landmark Constitutional Court judgment in which it shed more clarity on the National Credit Act in relation to consumers. The judge said the Constitutional Court s Nkata judgment impacted significantly on the rights of consumers &nbsp;in their relationship with their banks. The Constitutional Court has made it virtually impossible for consumers to lose their homes where, even after a long period of being in arrears, if the consumer made up those arrears and the agreement has not been cancelled, the agreement is reinstated, the judge said.
