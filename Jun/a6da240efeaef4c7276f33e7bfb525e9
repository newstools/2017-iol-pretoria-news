Pretoria - Two of the six charges against former NPA prosecutor and DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach and her former attorney Gerhard Wagenaar have been dropped at the Pretoria North magistrates court on Wednesday morning. Magistrate Brian Nemavhidi acquitted Breytenbach and Wagenaar on charges of defeating and obstructing the ends of justice. "The quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings are not and cannot be classified as an administration of justice and both are acquitted in terms of section 174 point 51 of 1977." "The same relates to count six where allegations are to the effect that the accused had been duly informed through a notice of suspension that accused one was the subject of further investigation by the NPA," he said. Nemavhidi however established that through evidence delivered in court the state has a prima facie case regarding the other charges. The basis thereof he said would only be revealed at the end of the trial. The charges against the pair came after Breytenbach allegedly shredded work-related documents and private files on her work laptop. This as the complaints emerged she was not impartial in her handling of a mining rights case involving Imperial Crown Trading (ICT) and Kumba Iron Ore subsidiary Sishen Iron Ore. The trial is to continue from October 9 to 13 at the Pretoria North magistrates court.  goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
