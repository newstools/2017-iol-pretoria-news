Pretoria - Cosatu has issued a stern warning to North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo urging him to stop interfering in matters outside of his mandate. This after the ANC provincial chairperson allegedly planned to unilaterally slash the salaries of public servants in an effort to turn around the province s financial situation.On Wednesday, Cosatu and some of its affiliated unions such as the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) and SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) criticised the plan, and did not rule out mass action if public servants were ill-treated and seen as scapegoats for the dire economic situation in the country .Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla called on Mahumapelo not to violate the Basic Conditions of Employment Act by undermining collective bargaining agreements.Pamla said if the premier and chairperson was genuinely concerned about the financial situation of the province, he should lead by example by volunteering to reduce and donate a portion of his salary to the poor and vulnerable in the province.He added Mahumapelo needed to focus his energies on sorting out the mess of irregular expenditure that was discovered and exposed by the auditor-general last year, that amounted to R2.9 billion.He also urged the premier to cancel the &quot;ridiculous plans&quot; by his provincial administration to buy him a private jet.Pretoria News
