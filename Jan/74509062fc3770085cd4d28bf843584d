Pretoria - &quot;He must rot in jail. This is why police brutality must come to an end?&quot; This is what was written on placards friends, family and colleagues of the late Tsakani Rikhotso Shimange held while protesting outside the Pretoria Magistrate's Court where the Tshwane Metro Police Department officer who shot him in Hatfield on Friday was applying for bail.Speaking outside court an emotional Jo-Anne Phillips said she had been friends with Shimange for four years and could not understand why anyone would shoot such a loving and friendly person.&quot;I never slept when I found out about his death. Its unfair for him to have been killed.&quot;&quot;We want the police officer who did this and his colleagues to see the pain they have caused all of us especially the grief of his mother,&quot; she said.Shimange was allegedly shot while trying to use wires to restart his car as it had been giving him troubles when the officer thought he was reaching for a weapon and shot him in the chest through the windscreen.The bail application of Constable Takatso Mashego 27, was postponed to Friday for confirmation of the officers residential address.Pretoria News
