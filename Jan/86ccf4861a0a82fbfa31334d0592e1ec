Pretoria - Dead poses will not stop until the set target of 40 000 followers on Facebook has been reached.This is the declaration of #DeadPose campaign initiator Karabo Mnisi, 18, of Soshanguve.The teenager told the Pretoria News on Tuesday that anyone against #DeadPose should ensure he reach his target or else it would get worse. I have 26 000 followers and I m only on phase two of these posts; I will clearly get what I aimed for as these phases escalate, he said.The first phase showed pictures of people pretending to be dead with no blood, cuts or wounds. But he said #DeadPose on Facebook was in its second phase. It shows pictures of people lying in a pool of blood. Some of the pictures show people who pretend to be murdered with an axe, he said.The fad has been trending for almost a week during which time people have posted pictures of themselves in various &quot;dead&quot; poses.They range from light - where bodies are twisted into unnatural positions, to immersing parts of their upper torso in water or just under vehicles to give the impression of being run over.In others, fatty cuts of meat are placed on the body and red liquid poured over it, with axes and other weapons placed nearby. The trend has spread across all social media platforms since the weekend, drawing massive criticism. But the public had better be ready for the next phase, the teenager said. Phase three is going to be more dreadful if I do not reach my target.&quot;He claimed that getting 40 000 followers meant he would be the most followed Feleb (Facebook celebrity) in South Africa. He was at number 6, he said.Mnisi said the #DeadPose was inspired by Hector Pieterson s picture from the Soweto uprising. The 1976 picture portrays that there was a struggle and someone died; I am changing the struggle history in a 'swaggy' way, he said.The trend has received a mixed reaction. @ZamaDube #deadpose pic.twitter.com/BoM138jU7Z@ZamaDube #deadpose pic.twitter.com/BoM138jU7Z gift mhlanga (@giftkhabako) January 11, 2017</blockquote> I saw a video of a kid crying coz her mom participated on the #deadpose, poor kid .I saw a video of a kid crying coz her mom participated on the #deadpose, poor kid .

However, Mnisi retorted saying he did not believe in satanism and did not care about those who did.He said the trend grew because people admired his style on Facebook so they copied him. My followers copy everything I do, so I knew it was going to trend but I never expected it would get countrywide attention, not that I am complaining though. He said although most people on social media participated, the only way to get more likes was if he shared the picture. I shared my WhatsApp numbers on Facebook for people to send their pictures so I can share them. I only share the ones that impress me. Pretoria News
