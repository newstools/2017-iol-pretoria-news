Pretoria President Jacob Zuma is expected back in the Supreme Court of Appeal in the coming weeks to back the National Prosecuting Authority s case to drop charges against him.Zuma has been in and out of court over the corruption charges case over the past eight years since then acting NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe dropped the charges.On Wednesday, the official opposition said it was waiting on the SCA to give it a date for oral argument with Zuma.This followed the SCA s ruling last October that Zuma needed to file extra papers and present oral argument in court.The president is appealing against the decision of the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, that the NPA reinstate the charges against him.But Zuma went to the SCA to appeal against the matter, and in the coming weeks the court will hear oral arguments.Zuma s spokeperson Bongani Ngqulunga could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.Opposition parties have been calling for Zuma to have his day in court.But the president has fought against the reinstatement of the charges.The Constitutional Court refused to hear an application by the NPA after the high court said the charges should be reinstated.The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, ruled in February last year that the NPA decision to withdraw the charges was irrational and must be set aside.A full bench of the high court heard the application between Zuma and the opposition.Zuma was facing a challenge within the ANC after some of the members and veterans called for him to go.But he refused to do so, saying he did nothing wrong.This was after former public protector Thuli Madonsela released the state capture report.The president is contesting the report saying he was going to court to challenge it.At the January 8 celebrations, he described Andrew Mlangeni and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as the real veterans of the ANC and not the others.The two ANC stalwarts were attending the celebrations in Vilakazi Street, Orlando, last Friday where Zuma addressed the crowd.His supporters in the ANC have also backed him and said he would complete his term as both head of state and leader of the ANC.The court hearing in the SCA will begin at a time that factions in the ANC are at each others' throats on who will succeed him at the party s conference in Gauteng in December.Pretoria News
