Pretoria Two men alleged to have been behind the killing of police Constable Solomon Lucky Sebati, his wife and two children have been arrested and charged with their murders as well as housebreaking.Police spokesperson Brigadier Sebata Mokgwabone said Tebogo Chidi, 38, and Karabo Mogoshi, 28, were arrested last Friday in connection with the murders on December 7.Mokgwabone said the men made their first appearance on Monday and the matter was postponed. They will appear again in the Brits Magistrate s Court on Friday.Sebati 41, his wife Mmatshepo 40, 3-year-old Quinton, and Tshegofatso, 22, who was seven months pregnant, were gunned down in their Mmakau, North West, home late in the evening.Tracey Sebati, 15, the only surviving family member, was shot in the leg but survived by playing dead alongside her family members.Neighbours said they heard gunshots at about 10:30pm, but stayed indoors, fearing crossing paths with the gunmen. I first heard four shots, then silence. Three more shots were fired, followed by screeching tyres and a car hitting the gate. After a few minutes we heard the little girl screaming and shouting for help, and that s when we unlocked our doors and went out to see what had happened, said a neighbour.The suspects allegedly gained access to the family s home and shot the constable and his family and then fled in a Chrysler Voyager. It was found abandoned.Pretoria News
