My brother-in-law works at a public hospital situated in a rural area. When I went there, I was heartbroken to witness the long queues that people go through in order to access public healthcare. From that day on, I knew I really wanted to change the situation. &quot;The reality is that there is a shortage of doctors in rural communities, and the equipment and facilities are slowly deteriorating, said Gani. I want to change that. My focus is on rural hospitals, I want to ensure that they, too, get the same care as private and city hospitals, she said.Also flying the school s flag high were three other pupils, Raeesa Joosub, 18, Aakisah Saban, 18, and Mediha Ukaye, 18 who all obtained five distinctions in various subjects that included Mathematics, Accounting, Physical Sciences and Life Sciences.Pretoria News
