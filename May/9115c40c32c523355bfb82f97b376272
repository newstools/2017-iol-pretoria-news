There is a slight change to this year’s route, with the finish moving from the PMB Oval in Alexandra Park, where it has been in recent years. This year, the anticipated field of nearly 20 000 runners will round off their trek from Durban at Scottsville Racecourse. The famous horse-racing venue last hosted the finish in 1998 and 2000, and it’s slightly closer proximity to Durban means this year's edition of the marathon will be a little shorter than past years. “The officially measured and certified distance is 86.73km,” race director Rowyn James has said. Much of the route from Durban’s City Hall to Pietermaritzburg is the same, but the last few kilometres, beyond 
the notorious Polly Shortts climb. Last year’s down-run saw David Gatebe break the revised route by more than two minutes, setting a terrific pace of five hours, 18 minutes and 19 seconds. The women’s race was won by Charné Bosman, pictured, though Caroline Wöstmann is expected to bounce back strongly after suffering terribly in the latter stages of the race, as cramps hit her badly, and she was hauled in by Bosman. Wöstmann recently pulled out of the Two Oceans Marathon with a hamstring injury, but she has now been cleared to defend her “up-run” crown, and put right what 
went so terribly wrong last year. Wöstmann’s terrible ending last year, even as favourite, again emphasised the enduring physical challenge that the Comrades Marathon remains, even in the modern world of meticulous diets and hydration plans. The human factor, and its ability to fluctuate, that is 
the essence of the race, and 
exactly why no one really knows what will happen on June 4, 2017.
