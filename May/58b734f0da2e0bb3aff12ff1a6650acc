SAKHILE NDLAZI POLICE have fired teargas and rubber bullets to disperse protesting members of National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) at the University of Pretoria. Three people have since been arrested by the police and are being kept inside campus. &quot; We are not leaving until they release our comrades,&quot; said Ephraim Mathebula. Police had to use force to disperse the crowd of about 100 from inside campus.&nbsp; The union's demands to the university included an initial 10% salary increase, but which it had subsequently moved to 8%, this while the university was offering 7% plus R3 000 once off. They are also demanding a 13th cheque. Protest action is causing a lot of attention on Lynnwood Road where one lane has been closed off.
