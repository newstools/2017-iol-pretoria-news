Pretoria – According to the report “Exploring the extent of and circumstances surrounding housebreaking/burglary and home robbery” released by Statistics South Africa on Wednesday, it is estimated that 670 000 households in South Africa experienced housebreaking/burglary while about 160 000 households experienced home robberies in 2015/16. Housebreaking/burglary accounted for over 50% of all crimes experienced by households, followed by home robbery which was experienced by 12% of households in South Africa. The statistics were revealed by Statistician General Pali Lehohla in Pretoria on Wednesday afternoon. He said although the prevalence of housebreaking/burglary and home robbery declined during the last five years, the proportion of households that think that crime is increasing has been growing. Moreover, an increasing proportion of households do not feel safe walking alone in their neighbourhoods during the day and at night. These perceptions may have emanated from the fact that home robbery reporting has been increasing. While reporting of home robbery has been increasing, this was not the case with reporting of housebreaking. In 2015/16 just over half of housebreaking/burglary (53%) incidents and 66% of home robbery incidents were reported to the police. The results also show that the odds of a white-headed household reporting housebreaking to the police were significantly higher than those of a black/african- headed household doing the same. In about 19% of the incidents of housebreakings/burglaries and home robberies reported to the police, an arrest was made. Pretoria News
