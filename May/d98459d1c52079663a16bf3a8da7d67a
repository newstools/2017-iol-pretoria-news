Cape Town - Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel announced on Thursday
in Parliament that the Competition Commission will launch a market inquiry into
high data costs. Patel told journalist ahead of his Budget vote speech
that the inquiry by the Competition Commission has been necessitated by the
high data costs. The telecommunications industry has been under pressure
from last year after calls for a reduction in the costs of data in the country. The portfolio committee on telecommunications and postal
services also conducted public hearings in Parliament on high data costs last
year. Patel did not give details on when he will approach the
Competition Commission to investigate data costs. “I will be making a request to the Competition Commission
to launch an inquiry into high costs of data,” said Patel. Early this week Patel said in a written Parliamentary
reply he was going to address the issue of competition in the telecommunications
industry. This followed the decision of the Competition Commission
not to prosecute MTN and Vodacom for anti-competitive behaviour last month. Read also: 'Data disappearance does not exist' This happened after Cell C lodged a complaint with the
Competition Commission in October 2013 against the two mobile operators, alleging
