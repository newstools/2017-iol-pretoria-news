Pretoria – The Imperial War Graves was established by the signing of the Royal Charter on 21 May 1917 establishing the Imperial War Graves Commission (by means of a supplementary Royal Charter dated 08 June 1964 the name was changed to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). South Africa was a founder member of the Commission. The duties of the Commission was to mark and maintain the graves of members of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth who died in the two World Wars, to build memorials to those that have no known grave and to keep records and registers. The work of the commission is guided by the following principles, each of the dead should be commemorated individually by name either on the headstone on the grave or by an inscription on a memorial, the headstone and memorial should be permanent, headstones should be uniform and there should be no discrimination made on account of military or civilian rank, race or creed.
