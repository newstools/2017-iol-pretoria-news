Goitsemang Tlhabye[email&#160;protected] WORD of Life Ministries International (WOLMI) church Pastor Noel Sithole has been given a R3000 fine by the Temba magistrates court in Hammanskraal. Sithole was convicted on five counts for contravening the noise regulation and environmental act during November and December of 2015. In delivering his sentence the presiding magistrate said Sithole would be fined R3000 or face six months imprisonment.&nbsp; In addition to the fine a suspended 12 months sentence was added to deter Sithole and his congregants from inconveniencing the surrounding community members. &quot;Your conduct throughout the court proceedings showed that you were not willing to take responsibility for your actions or to make amends.&quot; &quot;You need to take heed that this is a serious offence and should you digress you will be taken out of circulation,&quot; he said. Sithole previously spoke out about his arrest, detention and conviction stating that the court and municipality had been prejudicial to him.
