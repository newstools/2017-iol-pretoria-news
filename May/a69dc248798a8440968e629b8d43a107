Christian Mariorana, one of the organisers and a partner of Villa San Giovanni restaurant, said a large percentage of tenants have been operating from the airport and would like to see it flourish once again. It is always exciting to be part of bringing new family events to our community, especially when they are hosted on our doorstep, said Mariorana. For the first time South African Air Force (SAAF) will be participating. The Silver Falcons and Gripen fighter jet will take to the skies, and an SAAF Augusta 109 Light Utility Helicopter will be in static display.
