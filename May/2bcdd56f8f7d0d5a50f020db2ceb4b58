IT was an extravaganza of traditional food, clothing, accessories and everything else from 60 countries from across the world, by diplomatic spouses wanting to raise funds to support various charitable organisations. The international bazaar was hosted by the International Diplomatic Spouses Association (IDSA) at St Mary’s Diocesan School for Girls in Pretoria on Saturday, and saw a lot of support from people browsing and buying. Bazaar Committee chairperson Shanti Roseval, from Suriname in South America, said the goal was to raise money for vulnerable groups such as women and children. Roseval said this year’s event focused on four specific charity organisations needing assistance. These were Lesedi la Batho in Mabopane, a non-profit seeking to equip its community with skills and education; Ubulele, which focuses on the emotional development of children under the age of 7 in Alexandra; Phronesis Students' Development Trust, dedicated to educating deprived and vulnerable children at Kya Sands; and Mercy House, which provides shelter for women and children victims of domestic violence and human trafficking in Pretoria. Lesedi la Batho was also there to showcase their handmade crafts, including bears, aprons, hats and bangles. The charity's managing director, Chrisna Groenewald, said they had held a five-year celebration at the centre last year, and had European Union Ambassador Marcus Cornaro and his wife as guests on the day. “The day included performances by the Gum Boot Dancers from Boys’ High, the Tshwane Metro Police Department Ceremonial Unit Choir and the Dare to Dream ballet dancers from Hammanskraal.
