SAKHILE NDLAZI&nbsp; Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said it was in the best interest of the country to see the defence industry working together with government in an effort to reduce reliance on export sales to foreign governmental clients. &quot;The local defence industry cannot exist in a vacuum or develop efficiently without adequate government support. Therefore, our intention is to ensure that government rallies behind the defence industry,&quot; said Mapisa-Nqakula. She was delivering a keynote address at the first Ministerial Workshop of the National Defence Industry Council (NDIC) in Centurion, this morning.&nbsp;The NDIC was officially launched on March 3 2016, following recommendations as envisaged in Chapter 15 of the Defence Review 2014. Its main focus is to ensure that the local defence industry receives commendable government support to develop a footprint in the global defence market while simultaneously creating jobs and growing the economy.&nbsp; Furthermore, it aims to assist the defence industry to build a strong skills base needed for the sector to succeed. &nbsp; She said the ultimate objective is the realisation of a transformed defence industry that procures and manufactures locally.
