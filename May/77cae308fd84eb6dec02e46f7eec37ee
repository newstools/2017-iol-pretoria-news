Parliament - Parliament has agreed to launch a full-scale inquiry into Eskom
including its coal contracts with Tegeta and other companies and the
reappointment of Brian Molefe into the position of CEO. Members of the portfolio committee on public enterprises
told Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Eskom Board members at a
special meeting on Tuesday they were not convinced by the reasons to rehire
Molefe. Brown had told the committee she believed the
reappointment was legal and based on the legal advice she received. However, she said the court will make a determination on
the legality after the opposition parties to her to court. Parties in Parliament accused Brown and the Eskom board
of using different languages to justify the reinstatement of Molefe. Brown said she would support an investigation into Eskom. She believes the decision taken by Eskom was sound. “When Eskom board approached me to inform me of its
decision to bring Mr Molefe back, I said I would support it on the proviso that
it was legal,” she said. She said this is what she did and she stands by that
decision unless it is overturned by the court. Read also: Brown to abide by court's decision over #Molefe Moss Tseli of the ANC questioned whether the decision
would stand legal scrutiny in court on the basis the decision was illegal. He said the Eskom board broke the law by rehiring Molefe. Read Molefe's initial letter. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said it was clear Molefe
resigned last year, and nowhere does it say he took early retirement. “Chairperson, I smell a rat. Brian Molefe was not on
leave. He resigned from office,” said Steenhuisen. BUSINESS REPORT
