“The damage exceeded expectations but luckily the city is insured for incidents such as these,” said MMC for Infrastructure Darryl Moss. “The cost of damage to the two sets of panels, roofs and cables is estimated at about R45m. "The final determination will be made by the insurance company,” Moss added. Although it was still not clear what caused the fire, Moss attributed it to a technical fault. He promised that all the affected suburbs, including Moreleta Park, Pretorius Park, Garsfontein, Boardwalk Meander, Woodhill, The Wilds, Mooikloof and Mooikloof Ridge, would have power by midnight today. Yesterday, teams were installing new cables to replace the fire-damaged ones, rerouting the Woodhill substation cables and connecting them to the correct panels. The repair work for the panels in the two rooms was expected to be completed by today for testing and commissioning. The third room panels have been completely destroyed and would have to be rebuilt, said Moss. “A hard-working and dedicated team of engineers and technicians has defied the odds by working tirelessly to ensure that power is restored to some parts of Pretoria East,” he said. He added emergency outlets, such as health facilities, namely the Pretoria East Hospital, would be fully functional by today. He said ordinarily it took a number of days to get a substation destroyed in a fire up and running again, but the team performed extraordinary miracles and toiled endlessly to expedite the restoration of the crucial electricity service. About 11 suburbs east of the city, and Woodlands Mall, were left without power at about 11am on Tuesday, apparently due to a raging fire which was believed to have caused by cable-end explosion at the Mooikloof 
substation. The city’s electricity division team, together with contractors, knuckled down to work to clean and repair the damaged panels.
