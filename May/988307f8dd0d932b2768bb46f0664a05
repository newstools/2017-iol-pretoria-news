In the end, those protests took their toll: Jean-Marie Le Pen, the convicted Holocaust denier and co-founder of the National Front, was crushed in the election’s final round, receiving only 17.8% of the vote that year. In a symbol of political sacrifice, some leftists even wore clothes pegs over their noses as they voted for Jacques Chirac, France’s conservative incumbent. “Republican Front” is the French term for the bipartisan opposition that has prevented an extremist from winning the presidency. It is what defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, but its impact on his daughter’s bid in 2017 has yet to be seen. This year, the National Front is once again on the cusp of power with a far greater chance of winning the presidency than in 2002. Polls show Marine Le Pen will win at least 40% of the vote in the second and final round - more than double her father’s total 15 years ago. But there have been no notable mass protests this year on anything close to the same scale. Many politicians and voters remain opposed to the National Front, but few can claim to be taken aback by its ascent. “There was no element of surprise this time,” said Dominique Moïsi, a French political scientist. “In 2002, people were shocked that someone like Jean-Marie Le Pen could reach power. This time, everybody expected it.” When Marine Le Pen emerged in second place from the election’s first round with 21% of the vote, politicians from both the left and the right backed her opponent, former investment banker Emmanuel Macron. But in a remarkable break with tradition, others did not. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who urged his fellow leftists to support Chirac in 2002, has refused to endorse Macron in this year’s vote, who is seen by many anti-Le Pen voters as too much of a neoliberal. - Washington Post
