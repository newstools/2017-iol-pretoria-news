Pretoria â€“ "Molo Makhelwane," is the clarion call that the ANCWL leadership has put forward to inspire communities around Tshwane to build stronger, inclusive and stronger communities as they kicked off the Gauteng leg of the campaign. The campaign started off in Hammanskraal yesterday with a door-to-door campaign led by former AU Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, former Tshwane Sports and Recreation MMC Nozipho Tyobeka-Makeke and self-proclaimed prophet and Incredible Happenings Church founder Pastor Mboro, real name Paseka Motsoeneng. Speaking at the gathering Dlamini-Zuma urged community members to speak to each and not simply leave everything to organisational representatives to assist. "Let us start the conversation to build socially cohesive communities by saying Molo Makhelwane (hello neighbour)." "It simply means that we care about our neighbors and our community. We must be responsive and not leave it to councillors and ministers to help us when we are right next door to each other," she said. The group ended off the campaign with the handing over of a refurbished home to one of Tshwane's oldest residents, Gogo Johanna Rametsi, who is more than 100 years old.  goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
