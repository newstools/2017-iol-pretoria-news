Pretoria â€“ The South African National Parks (SANParks) will be compensating the families whose livestock were devoured by the five lions that escaped from the Kruger National Park recently. The lions, four of which have since been recovered and returned to the park, escaped from the KNP on the evening of May 8. Fear and panic struck residents as SANParks representatives previously said it was believed that the five male lions were chased out of the pride by dominant lions. However at a press briefing at the SANParks headquarters in Pretoria, Head Of Scientist Services at the park Danie Pienaar said the young lions had in fact simply wandered out of the park. "There are natural gaps and gaps made by the animals themselves. The Kruger Park is not completely airtight." Pienaar said in order to maintain relations with neighboring residents they had adopted a programme which looks at compensating for loss of livestock by the wild animals and they would be doing the same thing this time around. The first lion was captured near a farm along the N4 near the Swaziland border.   goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za   Pretoria News
