Vodacom said the purchase would give it an edge on Safaricom’s successful M-Pesa offering East Africa while cementing its grip on its home market for the year ended March. Vodacom, which is majority owned by British based Vodafone, yesterday said that the deal with Safaricom would make it a dominant player in the region and provide it with access to an additional 28.1 million customers.

Under the terms of the deal Vodacom will transfer a 35 percent stake in Safaricom to its Johannesburg-based unit, getting stock in return that raises its Vodacom stake to about 70 percent. M-Pesa is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service that was launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom. Vodacom shares rose 0.24 percent on the JSE on Monday to close at R152.86. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
