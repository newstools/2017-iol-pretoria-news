Pretoria â€“ Academic activities at TUT campuses have had to be suspended yet again today despite the university having issued a final warning to striking workers barring them from protesting. Willa de Ruyter spokesperson for TUT said the university took the decision to suspend academic activities at the Pretoria West and Ga-rankuwa campuses as the same group of workers had decided to contravene an interdict still in force. De Ruyter said the interdict obtained on March 2 2016 was still in place and transgressors would face action by SAPS. "Despite our best efforts to ensure no interruptions to academics we have had to suspend classes." "University management has convened a meeting to discuss the matter and a statement will be issued later on," she said. Striking workers under the #OutsourcingMustfall movement have demanded that the university cease their tender for a new security company to provide services. Workers providing cleaning, catering and security services to the university alleged the bid for new security went against an agreement they had with the institution to insource workers. One gate was opened at the Pretoria West campus under a heavy police contingent. Striking workers could be seen loitering around the university by 11 am as they alleged they were awaiting feedback from a meeting between university management and their representatives.  goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
