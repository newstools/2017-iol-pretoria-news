Voicenotes circulated via social media on Monday afternoon has stirred outrage when the people speaking in them divulged details from CCTV footage shown to police and Courtney Pieters's family. The family were not immediately available to confirm the details shared in the audio, among others that little Courtney's bones were broken to fit her into a carrier bag before being dumped in a shallow grave in an open field in Bofors Circle, Epping Industria. Police were yet to confirm the details in the voicenote, despite numerous attempts for confirmation. Courtney's alleged killer, a tenant who lived in the family home, was taken into custody on Sunday evening after evading arrest for most of the afternoon. He will appear in the Goodwood Magistrate's Court after being charged with murder. Courtney’s body was found on Saturday afternoon after she went missing on May 4 from her parent’s home.
