HUMBLE, trailblazer and brave were some of the words used to describe the country’s most renowned editor Percy Qoboza. These praises were sung at the Bambo Hall at Unisa during the Percy Qoboza 7th annual memorial lecture today. Qoboza’s son Vusi said his father was a trailblazer as he did not follow anyone’s footsteps. “He took decisions and stood by them”.
“It is now 40 years after Black Wednesday but we still let things happen in our country. We should not be in a comfort zone, we cannot let Black Wednesday happen again,” Vusi said. Speaking highly of his father, Vusi Qoboza said his father had a great love for his country and his people. And said the best way to honour people like Qoboza would be by ensuring SA had a bright future. “Conscientising the country about issues we are faced with and creating a safe environment for children is the way to honour people like Percy,” he said. The annual lecture is held in remembrance of this country's most renowned editor in order to help strengthen the pillars of democracy, freedom of speech and freedom of media to ensure that Black Wednesday never happens again. Qoboza was an influential South African journalist, author, editor and an outspoken critic of the apartheid government. His editorials were known to challenge white South Africans who were shielded from the horrors of apartheid experienced by millions of black South Africans. He died in 1988 at the age of 50.
