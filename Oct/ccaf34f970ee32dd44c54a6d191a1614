JOHANNESBURG
- The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has noted with alarm the
statements by the Competition Commission that the National Treasury ignored its
advice against awarding a multi-billion rand tender to Vodacom; because it would
have entrenched and Vodacom’s position and distorted competition. The union said
that country deserves answers from those who were responsible for ignoring this
advice from the Competition Commission. “The
federation feels vindicated because we have been arguing for a long time that
the state and National Treasury in particular, need to be extricated from
the shackles of private monopoly interests. The influence of monopolies and
established white businesses can be seen in tender allocations and policy
development; not only at Treasury but across government,” said Cosatu. Cosatu reiterates
its previous assertion that unless we address this right-wing ideological
model of the public sector that seeks to change the public service to operate
along the lines of the private sector and insist that government should be the
client of the private sector, nothing will change. Read also: Competition Commission's probe into Vodacom and Treasury's The
federation remains committed to intensifying its fight against the introduction
of private-sector practices such as public-private-partnerships, outsourcing,
agencification and privatisation in the public service “We commend
the Competition Commission for its tireless work in exposing this public and
private sector collusion. We hope that other state institutions will start
doing their work to ensure that we can dismantle this corruption and corporate
capture of the state, including holding the culprits involved accountable for
their actions,” said Cosatu. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
