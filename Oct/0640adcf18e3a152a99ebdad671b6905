• The pay progression disparity that exists between the teachers and the rest of public service employees. Teachers continue to receive 1% pay progression while other public servants receive 1,5%. • Finalisation of the review process of the current national policy on rural incentives. • The eradication of dilapidated infrastructure which do not conform to the notion of an ideal school which hampers the delivery of quality public education • The Department of Higher Education’s failure to recognise SADTU as a Union organising in the Higher Education Sector. The  march will also be used to express concerns following increasing incidents of abuse and violence against learners.
Marchers will start from Marabastad 23 Francis Baard Street and thereafter to the DBE offices, Sol Plaatjie House, 222 Struben Street Pretoria. Motorists are advised to use the following alternative routes: Boom street, FW Nkomo street and Nana Sita street.
