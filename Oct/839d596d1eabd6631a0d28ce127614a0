This means that on average, at least two people were killed in the city on any given day during the period under review. South Africa’s latest police crime statistics painted a picture of a country at war with itself, according to the Institute for Security Studies. It said South Africans were now 13% more likely to be murdered than in 2012. The total number of murders nationally rose to 19016 killings, an increase of 1.8% from last year. Hijackings and house robberies in the city were also on the increase in certain areas. However, the murder figures raised some eyebrows. In Laudium there was a 500% increase from two murders last year to 12 this year. Another worrying peak was seen in Erasmia with a 121% increase from 14 people last year to 31 this year. Sunnyside, known as the drug and prostitution hub of the city, has seen a 133.3% increase in the murder rate going from six people previously to 14 this year. In Olievenhoutbosch, 66 people were killed this year compared to 37 last year, a 78.4% increase. And in Mamelodi East, 55 people were killed compared to the 44 recorded from last year (25% increase). But it is not at all doom and gloom for the city. Some areas recorded a decline in the murder rate. In Soshanguve there was a 16% decline with 25 murders as compared to 30 last year. Further east of the city, in Bronkhorstspruit, 16 people were killed as opposed to the 24 people last year, recording a 33.3 % drop. In Wierdabrug there has been a 85.7% decrease from seven people to just one. Some areas in the city remained the same, recording no change. Atteridgeville remained at 55 murders for both years. Garsfontein stood at 11, Cullinan at nine and Sinoville at two. Most murders were linked to hijackings which remains a thorn in the flesh for police, with a high incidence in Brooklyn, Sunnyside and Lyttelton. In Brooklyn, there was a 200% increase in hijackings from 11 during the previous year to 33. In Sunnyside there was a 143% increase with 44 last year to 107 this year. In Lyttelton there was a 63% increase from 27 last year to 44 cars being hijacked this year. City dwellers were also at a much higher risk of getting their homes burgled. House burglaries rose from 1520 to 1986, a 30.7% increase. But much of the problem is still prevalent in the townships. Soshanguve had an 84% increase from 92 incidents to 170 this year. Mamelodi East has gone up from 27 to 75 incidents - a 200% increase. Atteridgeville went from 71 to 139 incidents (up 95.8%). In Garsfontein, the police also noted a substantial increase of 52% from 49 incidents to 73 
incidents. Home burglaries took a dip in Lyttelton from 82 incidents to 57, and also in Pretoria North - from 51 incidents to 35. “Installing security devices forces criminals to change the way they operate. This has a direct impact on the increase in house burglaries,” said ISS researcher Gareth Newham. On a brighter note, the statistics also showed a decrease in sexual offences (including rape, attempted rape and sexual assault) across the city. Reported incidents went down from 2160 to 2099, taking a 2.8% dip.
