The National Super Alliance (Nasa) coalition has announced that demonstrations to push for reforms will resume and will proceed daily until all the necessary changes are realised and free and fair elections are held. Opposition senator James Orengo released a statement on behalf of Nasa explaining that the demand for free and fair elections was imperative to safeguarding Kenya’s democracy, long-term stability and winning the people’s trust in institutions. “Our constitution grants us the right to protest, and we will continue doing so peacefully despite being met with violence and intimidation each time. As a people, we have overcome such tactics before. We shall overcome again,” Orengo said. Upping the ante, opposition leader Raila Odinga has also warned his party will not take part in tomorrow’s elections until sufficient reform of the commission has been implemented, directly clashing with President Uhuru Kenyatta who said reforms would only be considered after the elections. The president also recently refused to attend an emergency meeting called by the commission to “ensure a credible election”. Demonstrations were suspended last week to allow time to mourn Nasa supporters allegedly killed by police in Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori and Nairobi. While the coalition has called on its followers to refrain from violence during the protests, fears of violence remain high. In preparation for such scenarios, security has been ramped up and involves police officers preparing for attacks on voters, voters being prevented physically from reaching the polls, and road blocks and polling stations coming under attack. Those involved in preventing the transportation of voting materials as well as those taking part in rioting and destruction of government and private property will be arrested, the police have warned. - ANA
