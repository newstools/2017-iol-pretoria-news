“The commission in its current state can surely not guarantee a credible election on October 26. I do not want to be party to such a mockery of electoral integrity,” Roselyn Akombe said from New York, after fleeing Kenya. “The commission has become a party to the current crisis with commissioners ready to vote along partisan lines and not discuss the merit of issues before them,” Akombe added. Staff had been receiving last-minute instructions to change technology and electronic transmission of results, intimidated by political stakeholders and fearing for their lives, according to Akombe. A repeat poll was announced after the Supreme Court nullified the result of the August 8 election after opposition leader Raila Odinga lodged a complaint, claiming that the computers of the electoral commission had been hacked to generate a victory for Kenyatta. Odinga demanded electoral reform. - dpa
