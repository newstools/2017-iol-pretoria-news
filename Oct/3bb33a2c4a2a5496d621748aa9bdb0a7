JOHANNESBURG - If you live in Seapoint‚ Illovo or Parkhurst‚ you’re staying in three of the new elite suburbs in SA, according to the SA Wealth Report for September.

The fastest-growing suburbs in SA over the past year (value per square metre) are Seapoint and Three Anchor Bay (R30‚000); Illovo (R17‚000); Parkhurst (R12‚000); Noordhoek (R11‚000); Franschhoek (R10‚000); Nature’s Valley (R8‚000) and Zinkwazi (R8‚000). -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
