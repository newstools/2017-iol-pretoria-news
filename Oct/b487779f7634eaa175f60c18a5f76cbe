The opening followed an agreement between the City and the three taxi associations, Hammanskraal Taxi Association, Stinkwater Eersterust Taxi Association and the Ga-Mokone Hammanskraal Stinkwater Taxi Association. The associations would be compensated for the 10km distance they would forfeit by terminating at Wonderboom and not proceeding to Central Busines District. Members of the three associations would transport commuters from Hammanskraal to Rainbow Junction Station where commuters would board A Re Yeng buses. Senkubuge said the opening would improve congestion in and around the CBD.
