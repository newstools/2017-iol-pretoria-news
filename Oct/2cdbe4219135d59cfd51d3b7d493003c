Now in their 5th year, these annual Awards are
presented by Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) in partnership
with Brand South Africa and Proudly South
African. Lionel October, Director-General of the dti said: “The
JSE lending its name as a sponsor elevates the Awards from their inaugural
event in 2013 to what they represent today.” “The conferring of a South African Premier Business Award
adds credibility and enhances the exposure in their market of the sector winners.
It means a lot to have the backing of the JSE both to the hosts and to the
entrants.” Read also:  Recognising the most empowered JSE listed-companies in SA Mpho Ledwaba Head of Marketing at JSE said: “We believe that
these Awards are amongst the most prestigious in the business sector,
recognising the spirit of enterprise, excellence and job creation, whether in a
large multinational competing in the Investors or Exporter categories, or in a
small start-up. Entering such Awards is a way of evaluating your own company
and measuring it against sector best practices. Winning is a validation that
you stand out amongst your peers, and so we believe that this kind of
recognition is very motivating for business,” added Ledwaba. The JSE will next month host the media launch of the gala
event, which will take place at the Sandton Convention Centre on December 7. They are set to offer a training programme to five
executives from the company which takes the first prize in the Investor of the
Year category. Entries are currently open in the following categories and
will close on October 13. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
