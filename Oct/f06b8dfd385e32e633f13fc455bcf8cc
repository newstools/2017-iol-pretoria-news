goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za THE 10111 emergency helpline will be back in full swing on Monday as the South African Policing Union (SAPU) has called off the nationwide strike by the service operators. Sapu made the announcement yesterday today following representations at the Labour Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The union had taken the Saps management to court as it made its intention clear that it would find workers who continued striking, guilty of misconduct. The move was as a result of the signing of a collective agreement on September 13 at the Safety and Security Sectoral Bargaining Council (SSSBC) to which Popcru as well as the South African Police Service were signatories to. The agreement according to SAPS, effectively rendered all strike action unprotected, despite Sapu not being a signatory to the said agreement. Sapu had indeed not heeded the call and embarked on protest action in the city on Monday making their way to the Union Building. Oscar Skommere, Sapu General-Secretary, said the organisation was happy the court had indicated that the bid by the SAPS to have members found guilty of misconduct was unlawful as not all representatives had been privy to the agreement. Skommere said: “Their attempts of colluding with Popcru to declare our action illegal has been proved by the court to be illegal. Their dirty attempt to intimidate our members using this agreement will not work with us.” The General-Secretary however cautioned that the union's decision to call off the national strike was in no way indicative of the unresolved dispute being abandoned by them.
