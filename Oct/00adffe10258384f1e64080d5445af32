Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the 26-year-old advocate was charged with assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and granted R2000 bail. Thandeka Buthelezi, the woman he is accused of assaulting, said  it started with her  borrowing a lighter on October 7 at the basement parking of her flat in Sunnyside. Buthelezi said she had just arrived home when she noticed people she usually hung around with and went over to request a lighter for her cigarette. The group then advised her to ask the advocate, but he refused. Buthelezi claimed they started arguing and went on to say he took a beer bottle and hit her over the head. “I’m not exactly sure what happened, but I must have said something to make him angry because the next moment he hit me with a bottle on the head. He tripped me and kicked me after I had fallen to the ground.” After the alleged assault, she reported the matter to the local police, and the man was eventually arrested. Mavimbela said the advocate exercised his legal right to apply for bail through his legal representative before his first court appearance. He said while the suspect was expected to appear in court yesterday, a decision was made to afford the investigating officer sufficient time to complete the investigations.
