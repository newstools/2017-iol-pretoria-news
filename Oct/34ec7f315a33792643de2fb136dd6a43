CAPE TOWN - WhatsApp announced on their blog that you’ll be able to share your location in real time with friends on your contact list. The feature, called Live Location, should be available starting from today and is coming to both the iOS and Android versions of WhatsApp. How it works: 1.To use Live Location, you open a chat with a person or group. 2. Under “Location” in the attach button, tap “Share Live Location.” 3. You can set a timer for how long you want to share your location, and everyone you’ve chosen to send your location to can see where you are on a map in real time. 4. The feature also works if multiple people share locations simultaneously, as people’s icons will then appear on the same map. WhatsApp promises users that, like all of its other messaging functions, location sharing will be end-to-end encrypted. There is also a security measure on the timer. Users can choose to stop sharing their locations whenever, or let the Live Location timer expire.  WhatsApp now lets you share your live location? Relationship game has changed 💀💀😂😂 pic.twitter.com/tiLx2QBlys — Ayub🌃 (@AyoburRahman) October 17, 2017    - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
