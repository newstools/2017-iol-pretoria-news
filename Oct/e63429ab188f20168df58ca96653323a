Pretoria - Peace of mind and justice is all that Thandeka Buthelezi wants after a Pretoria advocate assaulted her over a lighter. The 26-year-old advocate was expected to appear in the Pretoria magistrate's court on Monday morning for allegedly assaulting Buthelezi on October 7, at a flat in Sunnyside. According to reports, the victim, was allegedly assaulted with a bottle and kicked after she had fallen to the ground following an altercation that had ensued after she had reportedly asked for a cigarette lighter from the suspect. Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the advocate exercised his legal right to apply for bail through his legal representative before his first court appearance. Mavimbela said while the suspect was expected to appear in court on Monday, however, a decision was made to afford the investigating officer sufficient time to complete the investigations. The suspect was arrested and granted bail of R2000 on Friday. The police spokesperson urged that an impression should not be created that such is a preferential or a unique occurrence as many other accused persons do exercise that right on a continuous basis. He said: "The suspect will be summoned to appear in court as soon as the investigation is complete."  goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za  Pretoria News
