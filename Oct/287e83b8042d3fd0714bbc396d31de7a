This testimony was made clear when members of the SANDF yesterday traded in their combat uniforms for sporting attire during the launch of the Prestige Week tournament. Airmen, military medics, sailors and soldiers from all four arms of the army yesterday gathered at Thaba Tshwane Military Sports Club for the start of the auspicious sports event. The Prestige Week is an event where sporting competitions among soldiers, drawn from the SA Military Health Services face each other head-to-head in various sporting codes. The tournament is staged under the over-reaching theme, Showcasing the SANDF”s unique character through military excellence. On the menu of activities this week are various activities ranging from soccer to rugby, swimming, cycling, athletics, basketball, cricket, handball and table tennis, through to fresh water angling, music and a variety of cultural events. Teams from various services and divisions of the army will, for the rest of the week, compete for top 
accolades. The awards will be presented to the winners during a prestigious awards ceremony to be held on Friday. Army chief General Solly Shoke said the games were meant to enhance and deepen social cohesion among the troops as fundamentals of a combat-ready military force. He said the aim of the Prestige Week was not to simply keep soldiers away from the office, but to encourage them to participate in sports to be fit physically and mentally and to be healthy. “Sport is part and parcel of the wellness of soldiers and encourages cohesion. “It helps people work as a team and requires discipline. “Participating in sport would ensure improved levels of discipline in the SANDF, as discipline is the cornerstone of any military organisation.” Shoke said he was considering making sport compulsory because in the military sport was not perceived as a leisure activity, but part and parcel of force preparation.
