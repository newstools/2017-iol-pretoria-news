In addition, City of Tshwane officials will lead by example by 
ditching their vehicles for more environmentally friendly modes of transport. Officials will participate in the car-free day. They will cycle in the inner city to contribute to a greener city and a healthier lifestyle. The initiative aims to build awareness that cycling could assist in de-congesting traffic. “The green mobility Friday is one of the City's October Transport Month activities under the theme, 'Together we can move the capital forward',” said MMC for roads and transport Sheila Lynn Senkubuge. She said: “This initiative is all about stepping out of our comfort zone and getting into our buses, taxis, ride a bicycle or do a bit of foot work on Fridays. "One understands that using public transport might not be as enjoyable as commuting in your own vehicle, but it does ease congestion, reduces emissions and gives you plenty of quality time to get to know your neighbours or people working around your workplace.” The officials will embark on a 5km cycle from Tshwane House up Sisulu Street, Visagie, Paul Kruger, through Church Square and into Madiba Street before heading back to the municipal headquarters. The initiative has also been planned for next Friday. On both Fridays, there will be road closures of Burnett Street between Festival and Grosvenor streets from 5am to 5.30pm. In addition, Hatfield will be declared a car-free zone. Senkubuge added that the City would close off Transport Month with the annual 30km green ride on October 29 at Hammanskraal Sports Complex.
