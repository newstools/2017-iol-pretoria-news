Corporations, researchers, philanthropists and others
interested in socio-economic development and corporate social investment (CSI)
are set to have access to a freely available body of knowledge that offers lead
practice content, case studies and research. The portal currently offers information on school leadership
and management (Old Mutual), financial literacy (MMI Holdings), philanthropy
(Nedbank Private Wealth) and maths and science education (Investec). Nick Rockey, Trialogue Managing Director said: “We decided
to launch the portal with corporate partners, based on their interest in
playing an active role in advancing the thinking and lead practice in
development sectors in which they are invested. This way, corporates can build
on their investments to influence the sector more broadly. Read also: Motor industry faces head-on clash over BBBEE “The Knowledge Hub provides one reputable source of high
quality information that will educate and inform a broad range of stakeholders.
There are many who want to make a difference, but need advice on how best to
leverage their funding.” Charlene Lackay, Group CSI Manager at MMI Holdings, said:
 “We are delighted to be part of this initiative. South African companies
have harnessed a formidable body of knowledge on CSI best practice. The Trialogue
Knowledge Hub will make this information ‒
which is especially pertinent to African conditions ‒
available to a far wider audience and possibly give more companies and
individuals the confidence to get involved in making a difference.” “Trialogue will provide editorial oversight to ensure
content credibility, and format content to maximise usability and
accessibility,” said Rockey. “We look forward to partnering with more companies
that recognise the value of driving thought leadership in the social investment
and development space.” BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
