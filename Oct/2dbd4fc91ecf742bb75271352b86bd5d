A bill removing the age limit for the president was introduced in parliament last month and MPs are currently holding consultations with ordinary Ugandans to seek their views. Should the bill be passed, Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, would be able to seek a sixth-term in office in 2021 when he is over the current presidential age limit of 75. Muntu said he had fought with Museveni during Uganda's Bush War to make it a better country. The Ugandan Bush War, also known as the Luwero War, the Ugandan civil war or the Resistance War, refers to the guerrilla war waged between 1981 and 1986 in Uganda by the National Resistance Army (NRA) under the leadership of Museveni against the government of Milton Obote, and later that of Tito Okello. But Museveni had disappointed him and other Bush War heroes, Muntu stated during a meeting with delegates from districts of Mitooma, Bushenyi Rubirizi and Ntungamo at Embassy tours hotel in Ntungamo, in the western region of Uganda, on Wednesday. Ugandan police banned what it termed illegal demonstrations over plans to remove presidential age limits. - ANA
