Despite investigations, no arrests have yet been made in last week's attack in which two women were killed in Mias Street. And the so-called “fence ninja”, accused of break-ins for months, has not been rearrested. Garsfontein police spokesperson Captain Ilze Jones said police were following up leads in the Mias Street murder. In the attack, three men tied up the victims and stabbed them, before fleeing with electrical goods. Police said the man, a senior tourism official, and his daughter were in a critical but stable condition. Twice in recent days residents gathered at the police station, first to protest against the release of the fence jumper, and then to hold a vigil for the victims of crime. Pretoria News
