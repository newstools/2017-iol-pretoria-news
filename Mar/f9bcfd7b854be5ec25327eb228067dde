JOHANNESBURG – Springbok centre Jan Serfontein will make his 50th appearance for the Bulls when they take on the Blues in their Super Rugby encounter at the QBE Stadium in North Harbour on Saturday. Serfontein made a barn storming return to the team in last weekend’s win against the Sunwolves in making his first start for the season and scored two tries in the game. Having made his Super Rugby debut for the Bulls four years ago, Serfontein has been plagued by injury in the past few years but he still remains an important cog in the Bulls machinery and that of the Springboks. On Saturday in North Harbour, Serfontein will form a formidable midfield partnership with fellow Springbok Jesse Kriel who will play at centre for the first time this season after starting two matches at fullback. The rest of the Bulls backs remain the same with Warrick Gelant and wings Jamba Ulengo and Travis Ismaiel forming a lethal back three while Handre Pollard and Piet van Zyl will be the halfback pairing. Bulls coach Nollis Marais has made one change in his loose trio combination with Nick de Jager coming in for the suspended Renaldo Bothma. Captain Adriaan Strauss will make his first start of the season after making a return from injury last week and Lizo Gqoboka will start ahead of Pierre Schoeman at loosehead prop. Bulls: Warrick Gelant, Travis Ismaiel, Jesse Kriel, Jan Serfontein, Jamba Ulengo, Handre Pollard, Piet van Zyl, Hanro Liebenberg, Nick de Jager, Ruan Steenkamp, Lood de Jager, Jason Jenkins, Trevor Nyakane, Adriaan Strauss (captain), Lizo Gqoboko Replacements: Jaco Visagie, Pierre Schoeman, RG Snyman, Jannes Kirsten, Rudy Paige, Tian Schoeman, Burger Odendaal, John-Roy Jenkinson @Vata_Ngobeni  vata.ngobeni@inl.co.za  Independent Media
