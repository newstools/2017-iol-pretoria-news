Wind gusts stronger than 260km/*  were recorded at tourist resorts along the world-famous Great Barrier Reef as the storm made landfall as a category four, one rung below the most dangerous wind speed level. It was later downgraded to category two. Forecasters said high winds would likely persist overnight, although the storm would then weaken rapidly and was expected to be downgraded to category one by dawn today. Police said one man was badly hurt when a wall collapsed at Proserpine, about 900km north-west of the Queensland capital, Brisbane, and was taken to hospital. But the weather was still too bad to assess damage fully or mount an emergency response. “We will receive more reports of injuries, if not deaths,” Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said in Brisbane. As the storm forged slowly inland after nightfall, state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged people to stay indoors. Cyclone Debbie made landfall at Airlie Beach, north of Proserpine, shortly after midday local time. “It’s very noisy: Screaming, howling wind Still blowing like crazy,” a resident said four hours later. Authorities had urged thousands of people in threatened areas to flee their homes.   - Reuters
