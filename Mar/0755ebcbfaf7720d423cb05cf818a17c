Pretoria – He’s been nicknamed a “fence ninja” for his ability to scale walls in the Garsfontein area. For months the suburb had become increasingly frustrated and frightened as he moved from block to block stealing but never getting caught. Some had tried to lay charges with the police, to no avail until in the early hours of Sunday when the suspect was captured by a group of residents with the help of a security company. Police were called and he was taken to Garsfontein Police Station. But residents’ delight that his reign of fear may be over was short-lived as word spread on social media that the man had been released without being charged. Last night about 200 residents, supported by anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee, gathered at the police station to voice their anger. Station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Kervin Solomons agreed to meet with a delegation of residents involved in local Community Policing Forum sectors and with those who had had recent direct encounters with the suspect.    Among them was a resident carrying a shoe found in a neighbour’s property. The shoe matched one found on his property. The residents explained to Solomons the suspect’s modus operandi and how for about six months, in the early hours of the morning, he had worked stealthily block by block, jumping from property to property, creating fear in the neighbourhood. When he was captured, those present had no doubt it was the same person they had seen in properties across the suburb, and had been captured on some residents’ CCTVs. During the meeting with Solomons residents complained that police had failed to act before and had now let the suspect, caught by residents, go free. Solomon said the man had been released as there had been no specific charges laid against him. He assured residents he would follow up today on claims officers had refused to take statements from them and why the man had not been held. He did not rule out a re-arrest. Pretoria News
