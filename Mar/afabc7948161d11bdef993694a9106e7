The 37-year-old woman this week testified about the alleged torture she and her children were subjected to at the hands of her husband, known as the “Springs Monster”. She was due to spend her third day in the witness stand on Thursday in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. But her advocate told Judge Eben Jordaan she had fallen ill on Wednesday afternoon when she testified, and could barely speak. The judge advised her to seek medical help and wished her well, so she could resume her testimony on Monday. The mother this week disclosed bizarre details of “kinky” sexual practices between her and her husband, on occasion involving a third woman called Blondie. The woman said her husband demanded sex up to 10 times a day.  Her evidence pertaining to how her husband allegedly tortured and assaulted their 11-year-old son left the court shocked. A court orderly with many years’ service in the police department often left his seat in the front of the court, admitting that the details of child abuse became too much for him. The now mousy-looking woman, sporting short hair and conservative brown and beige outfits, explained how she was forced to dress like a prostitute during her marriage. The couple divorced in July last year. The man, also 37, is in jail while on trial and his now former wife is on bail. Their five children have been removed from care and are taken care of by relatives. Pretoria News
