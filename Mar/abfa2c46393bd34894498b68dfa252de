And Barden Horst, 76, said he was sad to see nothing being done to recognise the memorial statue. He was chairperson of Gauteng North Chamber of Commerce at the time when it was re-installed 17 years ago. “This is black people’s history that we should pride ourselves in, but it is sad to see nothing being done about the memorial,” he said. Horst said a commemoration should have been done at the site last month to mark the 100-year anniversary of the tragedy. “Even London had some sort of celebration but nothing here,” he said. Horst said he learnt that there had been an SS Mendi statue situated in Atteridgeville which had become damaged beyond repair. The Gauteng North Chamber made it its duty to keep South African history alive. “We did not know the exact date it was initially installed, but as soon as we found out it was once here, we committed to bringing it back.” They managed to track down the initial sculptor who re-constructed the statue. He said the memorial statue was then re-installed in the early 2000s. But their effort was not recognised by the government. “It is sad that the public doesn’t know such a historic treasure here in the city because it was never officially unveiled,” he said. The bronze statue is of the head and torso of a soldier standing with one hand on the rail of a sinking ship – his other hand and eyes are stretched upwards. The statue stands tall in the heart of the resort. The SS Mendi sailed from Cape Town for France on January 16, 1917, but was hit by the SS Darro, sinking five days later. The collision claimed 616 South African lives. The site of the wreckage was only discovered in 1974 by Martin Woodward. Memorial services are held annually in South Africa and the United Kingdom on February 20 and 21, to commemorate and make the public aware of the fallen soldiers and sailors. Pretoria News
