He told journalists on Wednesday that three men from Mamelodi had been arrested for the break-in and theft of 15 computers containing sensitive information about 250 judges. Asked whether the police were investigaing a possible "inside job", Phahlane said the arrested men appeared to be just criminals. “A multidisciplinary team followed leads which resulted in operations identifying addresses in Mamelodi in search of the stolen equipment and the perpetrators." The police investigation yielded the name of a person who might have further information on the robbery, he said. “We are calling on Mr Nkosinathi Msimango who was in the vicinity of Mamelodi on the day of the arrests, and has valuable information on the commission of this crime, to approach the investigating officer or report to the nearest police station,” he said. During a search of the premises where the three suspects were caught unlicensed firearms and fake IDs were found. A getaway vehicle was also seized, he said. Phahlane said more arrests were expected. The police had not yet recovered the stolen computers. The burglary has been criticised by both politicians and the public, with some wondering whether the burglary was linked to the Constitutional Court’s social grants ruling. Phahlane said CCTV footage was being studied. Pretoria News
