Pretoria - Of the 2000 children with disabilities nationwide still not placed in schools as confirmed by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, a staggering 359 are in Pretoria – and social workers believe this figure is conservative and that the true figure could be much higher. According to the experts, South African children with disabilities suffered a great deal across all aspects of their lives. They were denied the basic human rights to food, health and education, and in most cases live in homes unable to adequately care for them. “Stakeholders are guilty of misspending millions allocated by the Treasury for the expansion of inclusive education,” the Right to Education for Children with Disabilities Alliance said. The organisation said children requiring space in special schools often found themselves on waiting lists for up to five years. Pretoria West social worker Lelethu Masango said there were still too many children not on any official record due to ignorance, poverty and shame. “Parents hide their children away. Many in informal areas and traditional settings are ashamed of the ‘curse’ of having a disabled child, while others are bogged down by the confusion that comes with ignorance,” she added.
