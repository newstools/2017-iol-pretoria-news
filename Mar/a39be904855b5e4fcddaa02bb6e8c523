Pretoria â€“ Thousands of DA supporters led by their leader Mmusi Maimane have embarked on march to the social development department offices in Pretoria, where they would call for the minister Bathabile Dlamini to step down. Clad in the DA blue regalia, marchers rediculed Dlamini for being "minister of smallanyana skeleton" because of the comments she made, suggesting that all ANC national executive members have something dirty to hide in their lives. They also accused her of undermining the Constitutional Court stance regarding the contract the department entered into with the social grants paymaster CPS. Gauteng provincial leader John Moodey said: "We want Dlamini to resign and on top of that the whole executive the poorest of the poor are going to suffer because of her poor decision. They are putting the lives of 17 million people at risk and holding them to ransom because of her."    Police and the metro police officers are escorting the marchers on their way to the department offices. Traffic came to a standstill earlier on on Francis Baard Street and Princess Park Avenue, where marchers departed to social development offices. Anthony Pete, 62, of Nellmaphius said he joined the march because he was worried that the government may not pay his social grants on April 1. Pretoria News
