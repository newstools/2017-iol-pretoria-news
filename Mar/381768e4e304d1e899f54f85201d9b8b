This was the inspiration given to stokvel members during the South African Tourism and the National Stokvel Association indaba at the Nellmapius Community Hall in Mamelodi on the weekend. The members were taught about travelling and investing. Andile Mazwai, chief executive officer of the association, said stokvels symbolised a sense of security and unity for many people who entered into them. “For example, going to places like Cape Town can be intimidating for people who have never been there or those who thought that they could not afford to go. “The task of booking, where to go, whether to take an flight or bus, is daunting. But within a group we can take that culture we’ve always had and use it to enjoy our own country. “It’s about the dream and some might not have had the inspiration to go out and get it. We’ve got to enjoy life and invest and do so much more than to just consume,” Mazwai said.

Debbie Damant, of South African Tourism, said they wanted to remove the myth that travelling, especially within the country, was only for the elite. “We want to inspire people to travel like tourists because it really is that easy and affordable to do. And it goes beyond that by also strengthening our own domestic travel and the economy,” she said. DJ Sbu also had a work of encouragement for the stokvel members, saying that “by supporting local, they would ultimately help each other grow”. PRETORIA NEWS
