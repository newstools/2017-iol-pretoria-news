Pretoria A massive R19 billion will be pumped into the extension of the Gautrain railway system, which will include links and stations in areas like Mamelodi and Hazeldean.There will be 12 new trains added, further expanding the Gautrain system to drive its efforts to alleviate major traffic congestion, MEC for Roads and Transport Ismail Vadi said on Wednesday.Demand modelling had been done to determine transport needs in the province in 2025 and 2037. Through the modelling process it became clear the cost of doing nothing in the province will lead to major road congestion in 2037, when cars will travel at an average of 15km/h* due to doubling of car growth, Vadi said.A feasibility study on the extension of the Gautrain rail network was recently completed, identifying new main links and stations which could be extended.One of the extensions includes a link from Samrand to Mamelodi, and stations include Olievenhoutbosch, Irene, Tshwane East and Hazeldean.Due to the complexity of the project, it will be split into five phases. The Gauteng provincial government is aware that a project of this magnitude will require significant funding from various sources. In order to address affordability issues, an engagement with the national government is required. This will be facilitated by the national Department of Transport. Vadi said most significant were the socio-economic development benefits, including an estimated 21 000 jobs created in construction, and a R19bn procurement spend on black-owned entities.During his State of the Province Address, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said the project would take 20 years to complete.Pretoria News
