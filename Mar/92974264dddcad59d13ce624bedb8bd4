Pretoria There is traffic mayhem in Pretoria on Wednesday ahead of a planned motorcade by coal truck drivers to the Union Buildings later.The coal truck drivers are driving in convoy on all almost all major roads leading into the capital, thus disrupting the flow of early morning traffic. </p> The result has been traffic that has been brought to a standstill across all entry points into the city, infuriating other motorists. </p> Some motorists have been seen making U-turns and opting to head back home than proceed to work in the city centre.</p> The trucks are heading to the old Putco depot in Marabastad, where they will converge and drive to the Union Building at about 11am.</p> They will then head back to Marabastad for feedback and then head out of the capital. This means the traffic chaos could prevail for most of Wednesday.</p> Coal Transport Forum spokesperson Mary Phadi said they were unhappy that Eskom could sign with independent producers, which would throw them out of business. They are also unhappy about government's plan to invest in renewable energy. </p> However, Phadi insisted that no roads were blocked. &quot;Our members are driving in convoys at speeds of 20km an hour in accordance with the speed restrictions into the CBD, and this can cause traffic chaos,&quot; she said.</p> Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said they granted permission for the march, but there was no mention of blocking roads. Mahamba said they truckers had indicated they would drive into the city individually. &quot;Blocking the road is illegal and we are going to respond swiftly,&quot; he added.</p> He said they would intervene and ensure a smooth flow of the general traffic.</p> Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said: &quot;Lawlessness is prevailing in our society. We had initially said no to the march because it was not clear what they wanted to do. &quot;It is illegal protest, but they are not stopping; they are just driving at very slow pace. I have instructed metro police to take action if anyone parks and leave their truck on the road.</p> &quot;The city cannot be brought to standstill. I have told police chief to move the trucks out of the roads. Those parked on the roads will be removed.&quot;</p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> Pretoria News</p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> The result has been traffic that has been brought to a standstill across all entry points into the city, infuriating other motorists. </p> Some motorists have been seen making U-turns and opting to head back home than proceed to work in the city centre.</p> The trucks are heading to the old Putco depot in Marabastad, where they will converge and drive to the Union Building at about 11am.</p> They will then head back to Marabastad for feedback and then head out of the capital.
