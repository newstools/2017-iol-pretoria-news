The bus then rolled on and rammed into various street signs before coming to a stop against the fence around a yard. The man was transporting the children - with ages ranging from 5 to 12 years - from various primary schools in Pretoria West when the accident took place at around 2pm on Thursday. “Apparently the bus caught fire and the driver jumped out of the bus, leaving the children in the bus,” said Xander Loubser, spokesperson for Best Care Ambulance Services. He said 16 children, as well as the driver, sustained minor injuries and were taken to various hospitals. Loubser said the 10 other children weren't injured during the incident. There were no fatalities. By the time the paramedics arrived, the fire had been extinguished and neither the driver nor the children sustained any injuries relating to the fire but received minor abrasions on their bodies. Loubser said he suspected the fire broke out due to the bus being old, as well as there being possible mechanical issues. It was unclear at this stage if the driver of the bus would face any criminal charges. Pretoria News
