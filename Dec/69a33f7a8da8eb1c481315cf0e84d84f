The tree was quickly nicknamed Spelacchio, or Mangy, because so many of its dead needles were dropping off, leaving the tree looking a bit bare.Chatter spread quickly on social media where Romans traded jokes about the spruce. Insults quickly turned to intrigue as the Italian media plumbed the tree’s costs and questioned how it had been transported to the city. “It has clearly been traumatised,” one expert declared. A consumer rights group asked an administrative court, which has oversight over government spending, to investigate what it described as a “shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists” and demanded that the tree be removed immediately. Some likened the scruffy tree to a toilet brush. Others unfavourably compared the sparse spruce to its crosstown counterpart in St. Peter’s Square, a lushly-leafed fir donated by Poland to the Vatican. “Spelacchio mirrors the decadence of the city,” said Francesca Nava, a television journalist who has lived in Rome for the past 15 years. Intrigued by the intrigue, she had come to check out the tree not as part of her job but as a private citizen. - New York Times
