As always during holidays, Bosman was packed with people boarding taxis and buses to various destinations, mostly outside the borders. Ngamula Mhlupheki, who was going to Harare, said things were very expensive in his country and travellers needed to take certain essentials back home to sell or to give to their families. “In some years we don’t go, because we did not make enough money, so when you go home you must make sure you have money and you have bought things your relatives need,” he said. Queue marshal Blessing Shame was also on her way home. “Buses that go to places like Harare travel for nine hours. At Christmas those buses will only stop at the border gate, because criminals can rob us if we make a lot of stops.” However, she said, long-distance trips were often prolonged by the police and traffic police as they stepped-up road safety campaigns. She said she was not complaining, because the safety checks were necessary to deal with the fatalities caused by negligent drivers. Joyce Mathe was travelling to Polokwane by taxi, and said it was important for her to make the trip every December because her children awaited Christmas clothes and gifts. “My children are young, so they still expect new Christmas clothes. I have to travel early so when I get there they fit the clothes in time. I am a single mother, my children depend on me, but besides that, December is a time to go back to the villages where our ancestors are and spend time with our elders.” Mathe said she believed Gauteng was not home to most of its residents, but a place where they worked and made their money. “We all came here to work for our children. Even though we have RDP houses here, when we say home, we mean the villages.” John Mkhize, who lives and works in Pretoria, said he considers Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal, home. "We party, drink and perform traditional rituals there.”
