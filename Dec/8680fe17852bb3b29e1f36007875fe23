On Wednesday, a metro police officer arrested a 40-year-old Tanzanian man with drugs with a street value of R108600. While they patrolled the Pretoria CBD at about 7am, the metro police’s drug team spotted a suspicious Ford Figo vehicle with a male driver. They stopped and searched the vehicle and found bags of dagga. The man was arrested, taken to Pretoria Central police station and charged with possession of dagga. Spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said this was part of the metro police’s increased visibility and crime prevention festive season plan. “We will continue to fight the battle against drugs and crime.” In Soshanguve, a 47-year-old man was arrested for possession of dagga worth nearly R1million on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Constable Zanele Mtsweni said the man cultivated the dagga in the yards of two RDP houses in Soshanguve extension 1. Police conducting a festive season crime-combatting operation responded to an anonymous tip-off. “They uncovered a hidden dagga plantation and arrested the man. The dagga was hidden in a crop of maize,” Mtsweni said. The man told police he used the dagga for medicinal purposes. Police uprooted all the trees that had grown to close to a metre tall. The suspect has been charged with dealing in and possession of dagga and will appear in the Soshanguve Magistrate’s Court. A week ago, a man, 50,  was arrested in Majaneng, Hammanskraal, with dagga with a street value of more than R20000. It was found in his house. He too told police it was for medicinal use.
