He gave her money, and subsequently embarked on a mission to help ensure females in his community have sanitary pads. The radio personality from Mabopane, popularly known as Bartin, led a group on a 15km walk to raise funds and collect sanitary pads for 2018 matric pupils. Letsoalo also took to social media asking people to donate sanitary towels at his gigs.  When that movement gained momentum, he then organised a walk through the streets of Mabopane. It became so popular that potential donors would wait for him on the side of the road. “I am a DJ and I have a lot of gigs, some of which run until the morning. When I met the girl who asked for help that morning, my mission at these gigs changed,” he said. “Realising that girls in my community suffered, I then had the idea of collecting sanitary towels at my soul sessions. After that I had an even bigger idea of walking and encouraging community members to donate sanitary towels.”  This, he said, was to include people not part of his gigs who were interested in donating. “When I started the walk at 6am, I was with 19 young people by my side. We walked through the streets singing and cheering with boards written ‘Please donate pads’, and people surely donated.”  Letsoalo had targeted a collection of 300 sanitary packs, but was disappointed to get less than that number. However, he said he was now more determined to do more campaigns and spread the walk to include areas such as Soshanguve and Hammanskraal.  He is planning to walk from Rustenburg to the Union Buildings to “beg the government to hand out pads to all South African schools, just like they do with condoms”. He thanked all the people who had lined the streets waiting for him to make their donations, as well as those who walked with him.
