And on Saturday, about 25 people, black and white, stood silently during the opening ceremony for two museums in Mississippi with Confederate battle flag stickers covering their mouths. President Donald Trump spoke to a select audience at the museums but left before the public opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the adjacent Museum of Mississippi History.  The flag protest was led by Mississippi actress Aunjanue Ellis, who said having the Confederate emblem on the flag is “insulting to the people they claim they’re honouring” in the civil rights museum. A bid to change the flag was defeated in a 2001 referendum. In paying tribute to civil rights activists in Mississippi, Trump said “we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice” and “pray for inspiration from their example”. The event was boycotted by some black leaders, including civil rights leader and Georgia congressman John Lewis, saying Trump had sown racial division instead of racial harmony. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba stayed away from the ceremonies, citing Trump’s “pompous disregard” for the values embodied by the civil rights movement. Trump did not address the controversy in his remarks to assembled guests. “The civil rights museum records the oppression, cruelty and injustice inflicted on the African-American community, the fight to bring down Jim Crow and end segregation, to gain the right to vote and 
to achieve the sacred birthright of equality,” he said.  “And it’s big stuff. That’s big stuff.” Mississippi Attorney-General Jim Hood, the only statewide elected official who is a Democrat, declined an invitation to go inside the museums to meet Trump. Hood instead mingled with the public at the ceremony outside.  The state supplied many men as well as military leaders to the Confederate army in the civil war against the forces of the Union fought from 1861 to 1865. - AP
