Currently, Mahachi is at Lamontville Golden Arrows on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns “Mahachi is going to Pirates next season. It is a done deal. Both clubs have agreed. He was part of Oupa Manyisa’s deal. He won’t be playing at Arrows or Sundowns come next season, “ a source revealed. Manyisa joined Sundowns from Pirates at the start of the season. Mahachi arrived in South Africa with huge expectations three seasons ago but failed to make a telling contribution. He has been on loan at Abafana Bes’thende for the past two seasons. Sundowns spokesperson Thulani Thuswa declined to comment on the matter, while Pirates spokeperson, Thandi Merafe, made it clear that they will not be making any comments on transfer matters. “Our focus is on our last match against Free State Stars ... At this stage we will not be making any comments on the transfer matters until the window is opened.” Mahachi played well against Sundowns even though his side lost 1-0 at the weekend.
