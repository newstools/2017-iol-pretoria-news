Ian Rank-Broadley, whose effigy of the Queen has appeared on all UK and Commonwealth coinage since 1998, will design the statue, which will not be unveiled until next year. “Ian is an extremely gifted sculptor and we know that he will create a fitting and lasting tribute to our mother,” said Prince William and his younger brother Harry. In January, the brothers commissioned a statue in honour of their mother, who died in a car crash in Paris, to be erected outside their official London home, Kensington Palace. Diana, the first wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, was killed when the limousine carrying her and her lover Dodi al-Fayed crashed in a tunnel in August, 1997. At the time, William was 15 and Harry was 12. “We have been touched by the kind words and memories so many people have shared about our mother over these past few months,” the brothers said. “It is clear the significance of her work is still felt by many in the UK and across the world, even 20 years after her death.” It had been hoped that the statue would be unveiled before the end of the year to mark the anniversary, but Kensington Palace said that it was now envisaged that the statue would only be unveiled in 2019. The first permanent memorial to her, a 210m long fountain, was unveiled in Hyde Park in 2004 after years of bureaucratic wrangling and squabbling over the design. - Reuters
