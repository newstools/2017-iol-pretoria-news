The occupants, meanwhile, told the Pretoria News they were uncertain whether they would still have their homes by Christmas. They were placed in the complete, but unallocated houses by impatient community leaders without the approval of the City and provincial government. Community leader Joseph Bapela said: “The community is stressing over this matter because we protested outside the high court last Friday hoping to hear the verdict, but the case was postponed to (yesterday).  “Yesterday we got to court to learn the case was postponed again, this time to (tomorrow), to allow government lawyers more time to submit supporting documents.” The provincial government took the matter to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, hoping to secure an eviction order against the illegal occupants. However, community leaders were adamant that their decision was justified because the municipality was dragging its heels in providing them with the list of beneficiaries.  They said an eviction was unnecessary also because they had allocated mostly elderly people and people living with disabilities.   Bapela said: “The community are stressing because of this matter. A lot of them cannot go home for Christmas as they fear what will happen when they return. This matter brought a lot of uncertainty and worry to our people.” He said the community presented a firm argument in court and was hopeful the government’s quest for an eviction order would be brushed aside. MMC for housing and human settlements Mandla Nkomo told the Pretoria News that he did not approve of the manner in which the people were allocated houses.  Nkomo said the illegal occupants ought to be evicted to make space for the rightful beneficiaries. However, Bapela said the municipality failed to provide them with a list of beneficiaries for six consecutive months and that ultimately led them to take matters into their own hands. He said some of the houses were already being sold illegally.
