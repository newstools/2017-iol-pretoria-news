The carols celebration put smiles on hundreds of almost 800 orphans, especially when they saw several MMCs dressed in Santa suits. Msimanga lit the candle of hope and peace to kickstart proceedings. Freedom Park chief executive Jane Mufamadi said the children did not know what a gift was, but all that changed at the event. “You could not have chosen a better time to do this as this is the season of giving. However, you are not only giving these children the presents; you are also teaching them the importance of giving,” she told Msimanga. Msimanga said the day was not just about sharing gifts, but spreading love and respect for others. “Every child in the world deserves a memorable Christmas. And with that, I urge citizens that when doing their shopping, they find it in their hearts to buy something for the less fortunate,” he said. Msimanga also remembered the five children killed in the mast light tragedy in Soshanguve last month. A children’s orchestra kept the children entertained with Christmas carols and other popular dance tunes. Msimanga distributed educational toys to the children, who were brought to Freedom park from all seven regions in the city.
