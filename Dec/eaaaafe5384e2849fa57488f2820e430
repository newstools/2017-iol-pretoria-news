Places in these schools plus seven others in the provinces are in demand, and they received exponentially more online applications for Grade 1 and 8 in 2018, according to the Gauteng Department of Education. The largest number of applications were made at Hoërskool Akasia with 1525 - the school can only accommodate 240 pupils.  The second was Pretoria High School for Girls at 1 512; it only accommodates 343. Third was Hoërskool Gerrit Maritz in Pretoria North, with 1251. The school had spaces for 200 pupils. Boksburg High School and Hoërskool Akasia proved to be the two most popular schools in the province. In addition, 10 of the 11 schools with the biggest demand are high schools. Laerskool Akasia, with 1 308 applications, is the only primary school on the list. About four in every 10 high school applicants for next year applied to 5% of schools in Gauteng.  Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said by November 1, 98928 Grade 8 pupils had been placed for next year. But 40292 applied to only 34 of the roughly 620 high schools in the province. These high schools received more than 1000 applications each, but can accommodate only 8300 pupils.  Other schools inundated in the province include Mondeor High School in Joburg with 1515, while it can accommodate just 360, Alberton High School in Ekurhuleni at 1473 despite its 175 capacity and Sir John Adamson High School in Winchester Hills, Joburg at 1422; it can accommodate 320. The Gauteng Education Department opened its online registration system for late applications for Grade 1 and 8 on November 1. At that time, Lesufi said 402 schools had “received applications beyond their capacity” and were unavailable for late applicants. There are 1397 primary schools in the province and 123450 Grade 1 pupils had been placed by the start of November. This week, the department said only three primary schools had received more than 1000 applications for Grade 1. These are Laerskool Akasia with 1339 (it can only accommodate 200 children) and Laerskool Theresapark with1 080; it is able to accommodate 180.  In total, 77% of the 285834 Grade 1 and Grade 8 applications made before November had been accepted. This means more than 65000 pupils who applied early still needed to be placed in a school. School governing bodies determine the admission policy in line with the constitution and legislation. While the department had not given clarity on what would become of those who had not received space, parents last year flooded district offices and officials had their hands full trying to place the 7 945 Grade 1 applicants and 6 229 Grade 8s who were without a school at the start of the term.
