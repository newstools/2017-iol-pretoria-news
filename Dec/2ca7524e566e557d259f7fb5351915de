Church member Major Moya Hay said: “On Sunday, we will have a short service and after that we will take lucky packets and Christmas crackers, and go out into the community around our church, giving gifts and sharing the love of God with those in the streets and everyone we we meet. “We will take what we have to give with a purpose of sharing the love of God, being love in action.”  Hay said as the world would be celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, it was important to give and share the love of God.  She said: “We believe that we need to make sure that everyone understands the reason for Christmas and we need to make sure that people understand that we need to keep Christ in Christmas. It is not just about giving and receiving; it is about recognising the greatest gift of all and that is a gift of Jesus Christ.” She said on Monday morning, they would give two gifts to the youngest and oldest in the church and, in that way, they would recognise God as the reason why people lived.  One activity that would form part of the celebration would be lighting the Christ candle of the advent wreath and, by doing so, remember that joy, peace and love was through God, she said.  Hay said the church was very active in old age homes and crèches, and that this was to remind people that God loved them. She called on the community to help the church in order to help others. “The Salvation of Army is all about giving, but we can’t do it alone. We depend heavily on the public, so anyone who would like to donate clothes, food and toiletries is more than welcome to do so,” she said.
