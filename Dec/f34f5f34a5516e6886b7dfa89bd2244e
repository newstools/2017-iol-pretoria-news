The community said it is angry because the Red Ants broke down the wrong shacks. They said a court order permitted them to breakdown shacks only in Tsunami. A video is circulating in the community where a woman can be heard crying while a tractor breaks down her shack. The community is also angry that the Red Ants broke down their shacks on Monday and Tuesday while it was pouring with rain. Some said they refused the intimidation and fought to save their shacks. The police are still firing rubber bullets as the crowd keeps fighting back, aiming to burn one of the police armoured vehicles.
