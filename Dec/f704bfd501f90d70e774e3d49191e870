Spokesperson Logan Maistry told the Pretoria News: “Christmas in a correctional centre is just like any other day. However, inmates may spend an additional R75 from their personal funds during December for once-off purchases of sweets, Christmas decorations, cold drinks and other such items at the correctional centre tuckshop.” Maistry said, however, Christmas church services would be held during December, facilitated by spiritual workers from different denominations.  Although Christmas was commonly known for its delicious family lunches and loved ones coming together at one place to enjoy big feasts, there would be none such activities in prison; unless the food services acquired permission to prepare special meals.  “As stipulated in the departmental procedure, there are neither special meals, nor deviations allowed on the current departmental ration scales.  “However, the food service may acquire permission to order raw rations on approval of the head of the correctional centre to cater for special occasions such as Christmas,” Maistry said. There was also not going to be additional visitation hours as offenders were only allowed to have visitors as per their relevant classification group, whereby the number of visits depended on their classification. Offenders are classified into three security classification categories, which are minimum, medium and maximum.  The department further stated that individual privileges were further subdivided into groups A, B and C in order to provide for maintenance, retention and promotion of family ties with a view to facilitate the re-integration of offenders into the community. Individuals in Group A had the most privileges while those in Group B received standard privileges. Those with the least privileges were in the last group. “The placement of offenders in the three security classification categories is based on the utilisation of an Admission Security Risk Classification Tool,” said Maistry.
