Premier David Makhura looks set to take control of the party in the country’s economic hub, which suffered a serious knock during the 2016 local government elections.  Mashatile is not the only party leader expected to vacate a powerful party post in Gauteng. Deputy provincial secretary Dr Gwen Ramokgopa and three members of the provincial executive committee, Barbara Creecy, Mondli Gungubele and Nkenke Kekana, also have to be replaced. They have been elected to the party’s national executive committee. The ANC constitution bars senior ANC leaders from holding dual positions within the party. Ramokgopa and Creecy would, however, retain their positions in the provincial government under Makhura as MEC for Health and Finance respectively. Creecy and Ramokgopa’s inclusion into the ANC NEC came as a surprise to many. Ramokgopa was brought back to the provincial government in February following the damning Health Ombudsman report into the deaths of 143 psychiatric patients at Life Esidimeni. The ANC in Gauteng would also have to find replacements for Kekana, who was the head of communication and Gungubele  who was the chairof the party’s disciplinary committee in the province. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi’s refusal to accept nomination for the ANC NEC also triggered speculation that that he was eyeing a position in the province’s leadership echelons. The leaders can be replaced through a special provincial council or be appointed at a PEC sitting. The ANC in the North West also has five members in the NEC, including provincial secretary Dakota Legoete and ANC Youth League president Collen Maine. The election of Free State strongman Ace Magashule has also opened a vacancy for a provincial chairman and premier in the Free State. Political analyst, Professor Tinyiko Maluleke, said Gauteng played an important role to assist Cyril Ramaphosa to ascend to the ANC presidency.
