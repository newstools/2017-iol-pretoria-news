Between October last year up until the festive season and into the hot summer months of this year, 55% of drownings took place in coastal areas. “These statistics are a shocking reality,” Sea Rescue South Africa said.  Of these children, 40%  came from KwaZulu-Natal and 31.37% f children from Gauteng.  Autumn fatalities were at 13%, going down to 12% in winter. ER24 paramedics said drowning was as fleeting as a child going into a swimming pool while unsuspecting adults were around. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said a 12-year-old girl drowned last week in a residence pool in Valhalla. Meiring said when paramedics arrived they found the body of the child lying next to the swimming pool covered in a blanket, while two other young girls and an elderly woman were nearby. They assessed her and found that she showed no signs of life. “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead.” Netcare 911 said people at the beach and swimming pools must be absolutely vigilant when small children and older individuals were concerned. They must keep a watchful eye on children at all times when around water.  If at the beach, swim where lifeguards are on duty and keep to the specifically demarcated areas designated for safe swimming. “For your own safety swim in the areas closest to the lifeguards. Be mindful of warning signs that may indicate dangerous swimming conditions such as strong currents, sharks and other dangerous sea life as well as contaminated water,” the company said.  For the general populace, which included inland areas like Pretoria, Netcare 911 said: “Young children and inexperienced swimmers should wear life jackets or swimming aids to ensure their safety. “If you cannot swim to the shore, float or tread water until you are safe from the rip current."
