The concept was developed to encourage young South Africans to embrace positive leadership skills. The Next Madiba aims to identify youths with command, youths making a difference and youths portraying the values of the late iconic world statesman Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who was popularly known as Madiba.  The show is about building youth leaders for a better future through a combination of Mandela's values, such as freedom, human rights, democracy, service, dignity, peace, non-racialism, equality/fairness and justice, and the pillars of leadership (willingness, accountability, attitude, vision, action and influence).  The new show will target and empower young black South Africans between the ages 18 and 25.  The winner will walk away with R1million. Johannesburg-based CreativeMagic Group is the production company behind the project that will coincide with the Nelson Mandela Centenary Celebrations next year. The show will broadcast locally.
