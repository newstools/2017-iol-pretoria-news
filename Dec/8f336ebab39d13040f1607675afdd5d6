goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za WHILE the City does its bit to alleviate residents' water woes by handing over more project sites for the replacement of the old water network system they are pleading with consumers to remain water wise. Areas across Tshwane such as Ga-rankuwa, Centurion,  Hennopspark, Clubview, Ekangala, Hammanskraal and Moreleta, to name a few have been plagued with burst water pipes this year. Presiding over the handover of three sites across the city, MMC for Infrastructure, Darryl Moss, said the projects were part of the pipe replacement project which was an overarching project for the whole city. Moss said the project specifically focused on replacing pipes which were past their design lifetime. He said this was particularly a key focus point of the city as water management and in particular the infrastructure demands were at a backlog of R2 billion. Moss said: “A lot of these pipes are made from asbestos cement which were laid over 50 to 60 years ago. And once asbestos cement starts breaking it just continues to break down the length of the pipe.” He said as a result, efforts by the city to mend the broken pipes proved fruitless as once a pipe burst in one area another break would occur weeks later down the same line. The projects handed over in Moreleta, Babelegi Industrial in Hammanskraal and Eersterust will cost the city roughly R72.9 million. R150 million is to be used for pipe replacements for this financial year.
