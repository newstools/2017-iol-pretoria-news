The group of about 30 protesters also threatened to shut down the public broadcaster ahead of the ANC conference, which starts tomorrow, if the board did not meet their demands for the increase. The workers, affiliated to the Communications Workers’ Union and the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union, took part in the strike after the SABC said they should only expect a 4.5% increase. Both unions declined the offer, which resulted in a nationwide strike that started yesterday. The protesters were seen holding placards on which were written, “Are we a joke to you?” and “4.5% increase”. Programming was affected, with radio stations playing mostly music without presenters. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said the public broadcaster met unions to discuss the revised salary increase and that both unions were offered a 4.5% increase which would be applicable for the last six months of the 2017/18 financial year. Minister of Communications Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said she respected the constitutional right of workers to embark on protest action. She said she believed that peaceful wage negotiations should not be subordinated to strike action. Kubayi-Ngubane called on all stakeholders to engage in peaceful and constructive wage negotiations. “The SABC has experienced revenue loss in the past. As a result the current financial situation at the broadcasting corporation is untenable. “It is my plea that all parties involved in the negotiation process should avoid engaging in any 
activities that could lead to further revenue loss,” said Kubayi-
Ngubane. She also appealed for patience to allow the negotiations and consultation process to unfold in a more balanced manner. The talks should thus take into account all factors and concerns raised by all parties.
