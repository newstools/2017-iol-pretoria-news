The event will reportedly be held tomorrow at the Tshwane Events Centre, commonly known as the Pretoria showgrounds. As if that wasn't enough, the Pretoria-based Malawian pastor took to Facebook to show off his daughter’s sixth birthday present.  Together with the images of the luxury car, Bushiri paid tribute to his daughter: “I always count myself blessed during this time of the year because I get the honor (sic) to celebrate not only one but two God-given gifts in my life. “I celebrate the birth of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and also the birth of our first daughter, Israella Bushiri... “My sweet little daughter, my pride and joy. May God’s loving kindness always shine on your beautiful face. I prophesy long life! You shall be great and yours shall be a life that heaven celebrates. Happy birthday my princess!” While some of his social media followers thought this was cute, others thought the pastor was out there robbing the people.
