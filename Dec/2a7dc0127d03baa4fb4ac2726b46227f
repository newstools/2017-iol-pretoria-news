Sundowns confirmed that they parted ways with Mashaba in October. The club didn’t pay his October salary as they maintained that the player is no longer on their books. His agent Tim Sukazi then referred the matter to the Premier Soccer League's dispute resolution chamber (DRC). Sukazi said Mashaba was set to return to Sundowns. “The matter is no longer with the DRC. We settled it and all the player's payments are up to date now. He got his November salary plus the one he didn’t receive in October,” Sukazi explained. Mashaba was accused of reporting to training late, missing during pre-season, and misconduct against Baroka FC last season when he was alleged to have substituted himself. “Mashaba is on rehab. He should start training in January and he will return to Sundowns,” Sukazi stated. Mashaba’s contract with Sundowns is set to expire in June. Kaizer Chiefs showed interest in his services during the previous transfer window. Sundowns spokeperson Thulani Thuswa asked to be texted. We were still waiting for the club’s response regarding the matter. - MINENHLE MKHIZE
