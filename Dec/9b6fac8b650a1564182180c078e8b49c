The organisation was formed to help disadvantaged children at schools, old people and orphans in the city. As part of improving the standard of living of orphans and disabled children, they were given food parcels, cheques, and other materials that each orphanage had requested.  Founder Isaac Maluleka said: “This charity celebration is meant for networking, spending a day with orphans or disabled children and putting a smile in one’s life.” Donations had been received from different stakeholders within the city, said Maluleka, adding that they would try and help more than 10 orphanages next year.  At the event, funders adopted pupils who would be assisted with school fees, stationery, toiletry and other personal matters. Heart Twala, from Dunduzane Orphanage in Nelmapius, said: “We are happy; we were invited and
were given groceries, cheques and other things needed at the orphanage.” Freddy Fassie of Fassie Security adopted five children and said his company would continue to improve the lives of orphans. - Staff Reporter
