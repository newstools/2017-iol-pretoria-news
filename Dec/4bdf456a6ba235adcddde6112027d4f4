The new mugs meant the old ladies and gentlemen would not sip their tea and coffee out of old and broken mugs.  
As an early Christmas gesture the Pretoria West Bridge Club collected about 120 mugs for the elderly.  On the receiving end was a happy grandmother Christina Msimango who said the mugs were a pleasant gift and a great gesture and wanted the Pretoria West  Bridge Club to do what they did to other old people in other areas.  
Co-ordinator of the centre Gloria Mbeve said the gesture was appreciated because it meant the senior citizens would drink out of new mugs, each and every sip by them will make them think of the appreciation from the community.  “This was a great gesture, it shows that people care about the elderly and it made them smile especially during a time where Christmas was approaching.  "And as management we are very thankful, we will not stress over whether we have enough utensils,” she said.
