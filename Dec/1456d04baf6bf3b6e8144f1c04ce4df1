Struggle stalwarts Sophie de Bruyn, George Bizos and Tokyo Sexwale will lead this year’s walk. Nelson Mandela Foundation ambassadors and football legends Lucas Radebe, Aaron Mokoena and Kalusha Bwalya, as well as the cast of Isidingo, will also take part in the walk. The route retraces the steps of the motorcade that carried Nelson Mandela’s body from 1 Military Hospital to the Union Buildings, where he lay in state for five days after his death four years ago. The walk, held every year since Mandela’s death, will go past Lilian Ngoyi Square, Tshwane House and Sammy Marks Square. It will start at the Union Buildings, with participants taking part in the 10km or 5km walk through the CBD before they head back to the starting point. The day will also include a wreath-laying ceremony at the Union Buildings. Organisers said those not participating in the walk would get a chance to view the Mandela exhibition at the venue, curated by the foundation. The Nelson Mandela Foundation, in partnership with the provincial government and City of Tshwane, said they would introduce an open-air market for the first time. “The market includes food stalls and beer gardens which allow families to get together and enjoy each other’s company while trying out some good food. "Parents can relax and shop around while the kids are treated to various games, face painting and jumping castles,” they said. Organisers said that to keep parents at ease and ensure the safety of the little ones, childminders would be available to manage the area. The market will be open from 8am until 2pm. The wreath-laying ceremony will start at 7am and the walk at 7.30am. Online registration closes today, but registration on site closes tomorrow between noon and 7pm. Participants can also register on the day of the event between 5am and 7am. Government Avenue, Zeederberg, Stanza Bopape, Nelson Mandela Drive, Visagie, Sophie de Bruyn, Kgosi Mampuru, WF Nkomo, Bosman and Madiba streets will be closed on the day.
