goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za THE Khoisan trio who undertook a three week journey walking from Port Elizabeth to Pretoria to demand recognition of their culture and language, are willing to wait as long as it takes for the president. The men led by Chief Khoisan SA, said they started their journey to the Union Buildings in the capital city, in order to deliver four demands to President Jacob Zuma or his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa. The men arrived on Wednesday and have erected tents to await the return of the president. The Chief said their first demand was for the South African government to officially recognise the community as the first citizens of the country. And secondly for the language, which was emblazoned on South Africa's coat of arms to finally be included as an official language. He also said they wanted the 1913 Land Claims Act to be scrapped or amended, as it was holding them from owning land. "We had land long before that time being the first nation. We don't want to be referred to as coloureds, rather call us Khoisan, bushmen, san or nama but we are not coloureds," the Chief said. He added: “This is not the first time we are making this call and we are prepared to wait for them to accept our memorandum. We are a patient people.”
