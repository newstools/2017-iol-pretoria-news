This week headmistress Karen du Toit hosted a small reception to thank those who had been involved in a number of improvements to the school, including the bridge. She announced a new garden, created between the wings would be called the Margaret Roberts Memorial Garden and feature Margaret Roberts roses and lavender. Roberts, the herbal specialist, who died earlier this year, attended the school, as did her daughters. They were there to honour her and Sandy Roberts explained the new seed benches which form part of the paved quad and garden, a popular area for girls to relax between lessons. Here, from next year, letters written by Grade 8s starting at the school will be sealed and stored with seeds - which symbolise the foundations of life - for the duration of their stay at the school. Aside from the interlinking bridge which alleviates the traffic caused by girls going downstairs to cross to the other side, old prefabricated classrooms have been replaced and, through repurposing of rooms, a small clinic has been created where a book-room was, while there is a good size book-room in the new wing. The staffroom was upgraded and some new toilets provided. Girls High dates back to 1907 and its original building, designed by Sir Herbert Baker, is a national monument. The school is one of the most prestigious and popular schools in the city and receives one of the highest number of applications for Grade 8 places in the province.
