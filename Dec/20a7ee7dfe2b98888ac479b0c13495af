SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said safety was a priority at this time of year. Operations were already under way since the launch of the festive safety campaign in October, he said. He was reluctant to divulge which malls would receive heightened police presence, fearing this would give criminals insight and an upper hand. “Unfortunately, it is during this time that opportunistic criminals prey on unsuspecting victims,” Naidoo said. Police have also met shopping centre managements to discuss issues as they brace themselves for the seasonal surge.  Naidoo said the police already had the commitment of various critical stakeholders, including the national and provincial road traffic departments and other departments within the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster.   Last year, there were more than 250 robberies at shopping centres countrywide, and Naidoo said they were looking to reduce that number. He said the police had put together a comprehensive operational plan to mitigate the threats of criminality in general.  The plan entailed the deployment of highly visible, multi-disciplinary, law enforcement teams that will focus on various critical areas.  These include addressing aggravated armed robberies 
such as house robberies, 
business robberies and vehicle hijackings; and enforcing various legislation such as the Firearm and Liquor Acts.  “To achieve these objectives there are multiple intelligence-driven and high visibility operations at identified areas, which have already begun. “These operations will include regular vehicle and foot patrols, roadblocks, cordon and search operations and the tracing of wanted suspects,” said Naidoo.
