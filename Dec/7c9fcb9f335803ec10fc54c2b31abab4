“I will say that people love Michael Jackson so much that they welcome people like myself that keep his spirit alive.” He has performed his acclaimed tribute to the late, great superstar for many audiences in places such as the Eiffel Tower, Moulin Rouge and Champs-Élysées in Paris. He said people could expect a lot from his performances at the Roodepoort Theatre.  “The essence of Michael Jackson is his signature dance moves. My team and I deliver these to precision. Outstanding music and passion are the order of the day.” As a child, Jonathan watched one of the icon’s shows on TV and it changed his life.  “I immediately knew this was my calling, I have dedicated my life to being the best Michael Jackson impersonator. My audiences agree with this,” he said. “I love dancing and it’s part of me.” He will be performing exhilarating dance routines to songs such as Billie Jean, Thriller, Beat It and The Way You Make Me Feel.  This is not the first time he has been to the country.  He was here 10 years ago. He has performed at the then Coca-Cola Dome, Montecasino and the Barnyard Theatre for various shows including the Heal the World Show. The 90-minute show with a short interval promises to be an amazing spectacle with backup dancers and singers. The production is on from December 6 to 17. Shows start at 8pm on weekdays and 3pm at weekends.  Tickets are available from R100 to R120 at the theatre.
