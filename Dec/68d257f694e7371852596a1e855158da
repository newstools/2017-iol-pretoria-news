Yesterday the two counterparts, accompanied by their delegations, were in closed-door discussions at Zuma’s Mahlamba Ndlopfu official residence in Pretoria. Before the meeting started, Mnangagwa joked that he was happy to be back in South Africa - the place where he sought refuge when he was fired as vice-president by former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe last month. The move proved to be the downfall of the 93-year-old who had been at the helm of Zimbabwe for 37 years. Last month Mugabe resigned under pressure from his Zanu-PF party, the army and the public, leading to the return of Mnangagwa, who has since been sworn in as president. Ahead of Mnangagwa’s visit, the Presidency in South Africa said neighbouring countries “enjoy cordial bilateral relations underpinned by strong historical and political bonds that date back to the era of the liberation Struggle”. The significance of these diplomatic relations are marked by the annual convening of the Bi-National Commission signed in 2015 and co-chaired by the two heads of state. The previous session of the commission was held in South Africa in October. The two countries have signed more than 40 memorandums of understanding and agreements covering several fields including security, energy, agriculture, mining, infrastructure development, trade, transport and arts and culture. Trade between the two countries has seen exponential growth over the years, with Zimbabwe being one of South Africa’s top five trading partners in the region and on the African continent. South African exports to Zimbabwe last year  amounted to R29.3billion. - African News Agency/ANA
