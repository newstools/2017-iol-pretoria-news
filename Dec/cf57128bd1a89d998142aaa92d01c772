As today sees the start of the two-day Science Forum South Africa gathering, exhibitors came in their numbers to the CSIR to showcase their products to more than 2 800 delegates from more than 90 countries.  Among the inventions displayed today is an Augmented Mobility for the Disabled wheelchair developed by Tshwane University of Technology students.  It focuses on mobility users with general disabilities in their upper limbs.  
Exhibitor Karabo Sedumedi said: “existing wheelchairs seem to not promote safety measures to the mobility aid used by persons with mobility disabilities. 
“Mobility aid users often face a number of challenges in their everyday lives such as a debilitations in both their upper and lower limbs,” she said.

The invention also prevents the possibility of wheelchair tipping and collusion with objects according to the exhibitor.
