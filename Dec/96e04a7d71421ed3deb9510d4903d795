Reshall’s sister, Renisha Jimmy, said the family hadn’t been able to get closure. After a year of trying to get justice, which was stifled by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), who declined to prosecute, the Jimmys are now pinning their hopes on an inquest granted last week by a Western Cape magistrate. Reshall died after his Ford Kuga allegedly burst into flames in December 2015. Several other Kugas ignited on South African roads, sparking public outrage. In February, Ford recalled 4556 of its 2013 and 2014 models Ford 1.6 Kugas, built between December 2012 and February 2014. “A magistrate has reviewed Re-
shall’s docket. We’ve been given an inquest number and we’re at the final stage. We are hoping to get a date for January,” Renisha said. She said the family were still fighting to get justice for her brother. Ford spokesperson Minesh Bhagaloo said Ford recognised how devastating Reshall’s death had been for the Jimmys. “Given the sensitive and unique circumstances of the case and the possibility of ongoing legal proceedings, we have nothing further to add at this time.” In August, it emerged that the NPA had declined to prosecute due to the lack of evidence to secure a successful outcome. “In the past year we’ve come across a lot of hurdles, not only from Ford but also fighting our justice system,” said Renisha.
