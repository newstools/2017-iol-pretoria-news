Centre owner Cilla Trexler told the Pretoria News that they had stayed up until 11.30pm on Wednesday night trying to ensure that all 409 dogs were safe from the rain. Luckily, all the dogs survived the heavy rain, but unfortunately their blankets were wet as the water had flooded all kennels. This led to Trexler seeking assistance from the community, asking them to donate dry bedding and blankets for the canines. She took her plea to social media, and some good Samaritans responded to her plea. Yesterday, a few blankets had already been donated, but Trexler said they needed more to cover all the kennels. To avoid the cold and wet soil, employees used bricks to lift the kennels up from the ground, and put pallets inside, with the blankets on top. “We put pallets inside the kennels because they assist with heat,” she said. Other measures taken included making man-made passages in order for the water to run through into the drainage system. They used sawdust in other shelters. Trexler said it was not the first time such an incident occurred, and it was unfortunate that they could not do much as the land they were based on did not belong to them. “We have experienced the same water problem before, but we cannot put too much into this place because we have been given a notice to move out. “However, we are yet to hear what the owners say because we have put in a plea to stay,” she said. The centre also looks after 300 cats.
