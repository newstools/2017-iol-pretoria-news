The venue was packed to capacity with hundreds of fans singing along and taking videos of performances of their favourite old-school love jams. Although many of the male attendees claimed to have been dragged to the concert by their spouses, they were caught singing along to the most popular songs. Matlhogonolo Phalane said she was thrilled to finally see international artists right at home instead of having to first travel to other places. Phalane said Mcknight’s performance was by far the most amazing, as he sang the songs she grew up listening to.  “I’m glad he didn’t change his songs too much and we could sing along. The one song I came to hear was Back at One, and after that my night was done,” she said. Alex Olivier said her night was also made with Back at One.  Olivier said that although Brandy was not her favourite, she enjoyed the The Boy is Mine, her classic duet with Monica. Siboniso Vilakazi said the performances were amazing even though he didn’t know any of the songs. He said: “I actually brought my wife here because they’re her favourite artists. This is just for her to enjoy and relax.” Ngwate Skhukhune also said he attended the concert to spoil his wife, but enjoyed the excitement of the crowd.
