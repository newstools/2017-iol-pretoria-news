UN Special Co-ordinator for the Middle
East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov was to chair the briefing, which would include discussions on a draft resolution, sources said. The briefing comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activities following the decision by the US administration on December 6 to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In response to the US declaration, the Palestinian delegation to the UN has been meeting with Security Council members to discuss the contours of a Security Council resolution likely to be circulated in the coming days, the sources added. Egypt circulated a draft text on Saturday, which stresses that Jerusalem is an issue “to be resolved through negotiations” and expresses “deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem”, without specifically mentioning the US move. “Any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded,” it said. Such a resolution would most likely be vetoed by the US, the sources said, adding the Palestinians might also pursue action in the General Assembly after a veto in the Security Council. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, on Saturday condemned the draft for a Security Council resolution, saying: “No vote or debate will change the clear reality that Jerusalem has been and always will be the capital of Israel. Together with our allies, we will continue to fight, once again, for historical truth.” The Security Council already held an emergency meeting on December 8 to address the decision at the request of countries such as Britain, France, Italy, Egypt, Sweden and Senegal. - Xinhua
