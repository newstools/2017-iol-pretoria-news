The drawing, which was made by a pupil at Selborne College for the class of 2017, recreates Nzima’s photo of the 1976 student protests which shows activist Mbuyisa Makhubo carrying a dying Hector Pieterson, while the boy’s sister, Antoinette Sithole, runs next to them weeping. However, the new version of the photo that circulated on social media at the weekend, shows two human-like dogs with one carrying a faceless figure wearing the East London school’s blazer. The drawing is accompanied by words: “The Class of 2017 Selborne College”. The drawing ignited controversy with some saying it was insensitive, while others deemed it racist. The school has since apologised publicly. But Nzima is having none of it and is determined to have the matter settled in court. “I’m very disturbed by this image. What makes it even worse is that nobody from the school contacted me to ask for my permission to reproduce it. I will deal with them,” said Nzima yesterday. “I was so shocked. I never thought that someone could do such a thing to me, my work and the black community. It’s a symbolic photo, which projected the severity of apartheid to the world. “The drawing really offended me. It’s undermining black people and it shows us as dogs. I’m really not happy,” said Nzima. The iconic photograph found Nzima instant fame as a photographer working for The World newspaper when it made headlines across the globe. He copyrighted the photograph with Adams and Adams Attorneys in 1989, which entitles him to royalties for its use by a second party. But a copyright lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous, said Nzima would have an uphill battle to convince a court of any infringement. “First, it will be difficult to prove any infringement, because the original image is a photograph, while the new one is a drawing. “Second, our constitution gives people freedom of expression, which might outweigh the photographer’s claim,” the lawyer pointed out.
