Dressed in all white and gyrating to the music, the crowds went crazy and sang along as the stars took to the stage. An almost frenzied atmosphere took over when gospel star Lebo Sekgobela performed the hit Lion of Judah, and when the DJ played Ggom hit Omunye by Distruction Boyz. The event is popular and attracts crowds from across the province and beyond. They witnessed amazing performances from stars such as Lady Zama, Encore and The Josh. Scores of popular local DJs set it off with a bang while hundreds of people kept piling up at the entrance queues from 10am until late at night. Spokesperson for Thabiso Mosima, of Zero 1 Two Multimedia, said: “It was an amazing and successful event. People were queuing to enter even after 9pm. “Some had travelled long distances. The weather was very kind and did not disturb the fun. As usual Sister T Productions did a wonderful job organising this event.” Patrons Dimpho Matlhaku, Lindelani Khumalo, Teboho Mokwena and Nomathemba Mnguni said they loved everything about the event. “I am happy to see all these artists perform live. I will come again next year and bring more of my friends,” said Mnguni. The organisers were set to donate food parcels, clothing and stationery to 10 children’s homes north of the city sheltering kids orphaned by HIV/Ads from a portion of the proceeds. Mosima said: “This forms part of the tradition of the All Whites for the past nine years, where homes such as Ya Bana Children’s home in Mabopane have been beneficiaries.” The event was founded by philanthropist and businesswoman Tiny Mashilwane - also known as Sister T.
