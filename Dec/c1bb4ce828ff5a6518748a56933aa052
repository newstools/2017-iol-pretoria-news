VIRGILATTE GWANGWA IT is Christmas out of this world taking place right in the heart of Menlyn Park today with children and parents being treated to some Christmas magic. Dancing, performing some magic and colouring Christmas cards and all things fun and awesome is the course of the day. Children got to enjoy some of the edu-tainment tricks performed by the Nutty Scientists who added science with a bit of Christmas magic. While dancing and screaming magic words like "whoosh whoosh" to make things disappear, other shoppers could not help but stop and stare at what was happening.

With her mother Rendani was doing shopping when they saw a group of children gathered and having fun and decided to join. And the dancer that she is, Takalani won the dance competition which got her a chance to win a shopping voucher to the value of R 2 500. However, she would have to return on Christmas Eve for the final dance competition with other winners.
