The elderly from across the township took a break from their daily chores and were treated to breakfast, lunch and performances by local traditional groups. The event was organised by the ANC’s Jabu Buthelezi Branch in Ward 67 and took place at the Mothong Heritage Site. It was partly in celebration of the centenary of Struggle stalwart Oliver Reginald Tambo. Branch chairperson Miller Madonsela said that had Tambo been alive today, he would have been 100 years old and they saw it befitting to celebrate the centenary with the people who were from his generation. Madonsela said that although they had little to offer the elderly they still wanted to host a party to remind them that they were the first citizens and that communities would be worthless without them. He said: “We are here because of them and without them we would not be here. They understand our organisation very well and have so much knowledge to share. “This wasn’t just about giving them gifts, but actually taking the time to listen to their stories and spending quality time with them.” Johanna Khoza 73, said she was elated the youth had taken the time to celebrate with them for a change. “I’ve lived in Mamelodi my whole life, but I’ve never been to this heritage site. "It is a nice day out to relax and have fun while also learning from the youth,” said Khoza. She advised the youth to respect themselves and their parents. “I will always remember this day as the ward put us on pedestals. It’s also special because we got to celebrate Christmas early this year,” she said. Christinah Mashigo, 67, told the youth she had no tips for a longer life, but was simply grateful God had granted her more time. She said: “The youth need to learn to slow down and listen. But they also need to remember to respect elders no matter how useless a parent is they remain a parent and deserve some respect.”
