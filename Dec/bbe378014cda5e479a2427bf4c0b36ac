SAKHILE NDLAZI Motorists and bystanders around the Sinoville area were taken by surprise this morning when a man was pulling a truck full of food with his torso, to the Sinoville police station. People took photos and videos while others hooted and cheered him on.  The pulling of the mini truck with food was the brainchild of community leader and motivational speaker Chris Batts who said: “Father Christmas uses a sledgehammer we use a truck and man power,” said Batts jokingly. 
Batts said if you want to make a difference you have to do things differently. Batts collected various food items, including tins foods, maize meal, soya mince and rice.

Three guys and two ladies took turns pulling the mini truck, with a rope attached to the front part of the truck.  They started at the corner of Lavender and Zambezi at 9:30 am and arrived at Sinoville police station around 10:45am.  The metro police and community police forum escorted the trucks.  
The 4km pull wasn’t without strain. Captain Annemarie Verster from Sinoville who also pulled for a couple of metres said: “ I feel exhausted already but I know it’s for a good cause,” she said. The food will feed well over 1000 people and will be kept at the police station.
