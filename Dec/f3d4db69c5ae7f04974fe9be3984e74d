Lobbying towards the party’s crucial elective conference entered a new, more intense stage yesterday, after Ramaphosa took the lead in the race, bagging the majority of branch nominations. Calculation of the consolidated figures of all the nominations from the nine provinces show that Ramaphosa was enjoying a lead of 530 branch nominations after receiving a total of 1860 nominations from Limpopo, Gauteng, the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape. Dlamini Zuma, for her part, received 1330 from the party’s biggest and second biggest provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, the Free State and the North West. Ramaphosa leads, for now, 10 days before the conference to be held in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg.  The last lap of the race could prove to be tricky considering the party’s stated problems such as dirty money used for votes, manipulation and intimidation of members.
