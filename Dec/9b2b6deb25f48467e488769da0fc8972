Rudzani Matshili Olivenhoutbosch residents and leaders picketed outside the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, against an eviction court order being obtained against them by the municipality after they illegally occupied RDP houses in Extension 27. This after more than 2000 people occupied empty houses without the authorisation of the City of Tshwane and the Gauteng Human Settlement Department, saying they could not wait any longer. Their stance was in reaction to MMC for housing and human settlements Mandla Nkomo, who said the City planned to allocate the houses to their rightful beneficiaries by the end of this week.

Community leader and part of a steering committee made up of different civil and political formations Joseph Bapela said: “The municipality promised that we would be going to be allocated houses, we waited for a long time but the allocation did not happen. He said the steering committee had been requested by the Minister Human Settlements Paul Mashatile. “We took people who have showed us proof that they had applied, and who had proper documents and allocated houses,” he said. They were gathered in large numbers outside the court, where an urgent application was being heard. He said the houses had been allocated to the wrong people by the councilors who were not even from the area.
