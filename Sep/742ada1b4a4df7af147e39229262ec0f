Pretoria - Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga has given a stern warning to drug dealers and slum property owners occupying the infamous  Brown Street in Tshwane, saying that their days are numbered. “We are very aware of the problem with drugs in this area. It is important to note that continued efforts will be made in this regard. The plan is to have daily operations in the area." Msimanga and the Tshwane Metro Police were conducting a bylaw enforcement operation at Brown street. Brown street is commonly known for its drug scourge by drug addicts. “Our preoccupation is to fight the drug problem while creating the opportunities for employment and productivity across the City to employ our people so that they may too live a better life and not be condemned to a life of poverty or even condemned to death. We have to rescue our lost generation from this and we have to leverage our regions and existing tools to make progress in this regard” said Msimanga. Brown Street, once a proud gathering point in the CBD where many a union march started, is now a shadow of its former self, with nyaope smokers and dealers openly doing business on the street.
