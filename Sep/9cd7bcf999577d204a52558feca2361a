PRETORIA- As many as 20 South African companies from the agro-processing industry will next week exhibit their products at the World Food Moscow 2017 Mockba in Russia. The SA Department of Trade and Industry (dti) said the five-day exhibition will begin on Monday, 11 September. The annual event is an ideal platform for South African companies to showcase the country’s products to a significant number of wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and restaurateurs. SA dti minister, DR. Rob Davies, said the objective of the South African participation in the exhibition was to promote South Africa’s agro-processing industry. The move is aimed at consolidating and establishing a market presence of South African companies in Russia.

This provides an opportunity for increasing export sales from the South African agri-food industry, food retail, institutional, and commercial catering,” Davies said. Total trade between South Africa and Russia increased from R5 billion in 2012 to almost R8 billion in 2016.
