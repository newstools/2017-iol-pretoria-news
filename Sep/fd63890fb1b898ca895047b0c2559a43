Johannesburg - Rugby Centurions - a prestigious club of those who have represented their country in 100 or more Tests - was launched in Johannesburg today. The launch was attended by former Springbok captain and Centurions custodian, John Smit and rugby legend Victor Matfield as well as founder of Rugby Centurions, Gavin Varejes. The group plans to promote the game with the integrity and passion that embodies the spirit of rugby. It's members aim to grow the sport across the world, promoting rugby at a grassroots level and taking the game to new territories. Membership is one of the toughest in the world to crack, with only 3 in every 1000 players ever reaching the 100-test milestone. According to Smit, “Every athlete dreams of leaving a legacy once they can no longer be on the field. With Rugby Centurions, we are giving players a way to make that legacy tangible. Rugby has given us so much, and shaped our lives, now we can give back to this magnificent game.” Varejes said the launch heralded the start of great things to come: “Rugby brings people and nations together and during the local SA launchwe had a glimpse of the bright future of the game." The international launch will be held in London on November 23. The Independent on Saturday
