Its continued backing will come as a boost to the two potential buyers as they prepare for a possible challenge from rival bidders. Nigeria’s Dangote Cement Plc, controlled by Africa’s richest person, Aliko Dangote, is among those considering
a counteroffer, people familiar with the matter said last week. LafargeHolcim Ltd., the world’s biggest cement maker, is also monitoring PPC’s situation, they said. The PIC owns about 11 percent of PPC, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s also the biggest shareholder in AfriSam with about 60 percent. - BLOOMBERG
