The tribute concert had music lovers packing the venue from as early as 9am while cars filled the busy Mamelodi streets. While some revellers made their way to Moretele Park, others parked their cars on pavements and partied the weekend away. Not even the evening chill could deter their feisty spirit. The popular annual event in celebration of local talents honoured and paid tribute to South Africa’s musical icons and other people who have made a major contribution to the arts. It also offered a strong platform for the development of local talent growing from strength to strength year after year. The day started with developing bands being given a platform to showcase their talents. The legendary Ringo Madlingozi reminded fans why he was still considered the best in country, by giving an electrifying performance, while Idols winner Musa Sukwene serenaded revellers with his popular love song Mthande. Masechaba Sefolo from Mamelodi said the annual tribute festival was her favourite of all the events. “The concert comes right after winter and at the beginning of spring. It sets an exciting mood for the rest of the year,” she said. She hailed Ringo as her performer of the night. Acclaimed musician Lira gave a classic performance singing Something inside so Strong, much to the delight of the crowd who joined in loudly singing and dancing. Black Motion took the stage and rocked the crowd. South African Music Awards winner, rapper Kwesta, also got fans rapping their tongues out with Lala Vuka. Others who impressed were Amanda Black, gospel exponents Jaziel Brothers and Selaelo Selota.
