Pretoria - "Motorists don't owe you R10 or a cool drink, you owe them service." These were the words Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said to traffic officers on an anti-corruption campaign at Mabopane Indoor Sports Centre. Malobane said the officers must bring back the dignity in the department and the public must be treated with decency as not everyone is a criminal. "You must bring back the dignity our department once had, not everyone that you interact with is a criminal be cautious when dealing with motorists," she said. She said that as a department they were against corruption in Gauteng as it was their very own officers who were taking part in the unlawfulness. Chief director for Gauteng traffic police Stephen Polide warned the officers that come October everyone that engaged in corruption will be dealt with. And the officials who did not report on other officials on illegal dealings will also be addressed.
