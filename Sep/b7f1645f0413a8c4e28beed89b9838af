Malesela James Ngoasheng appeared for a formal bail application at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Investigating officer sergeant Jeremiah Mpiti said that when he visited the neighbourhood, other tenants described Ngoasheng as a man who was always in conflict with other tenants - another reason why he was kicked out of the place. He allegedly shot Ledwaba because she  refused to go home with him after he bought her drinks and food at Ayepyep Lifestyle Lounge, witnesses have said. However, evidence led by the investigating officer in court suggested otherwise. The accused apparently got into an argument with the victim over a destination she wanted to be dropped off  at, after Ngoasheng and his friend offered her and her friend a lift. “Ledwaba and her friend’s intention was to travel in an Uber taxi, but there was a problem. That’s when the accused and his friend offered to take them to where they were going.” Mpiti said when they got to the Mercedes-Benz Viano, the friend, who was the owner of the car, opened the door, but an argument between the two ladies and the driver ensued. “The driver sat in the front seat and the accused and the ladies in the back seat. “The argument over the destination between the two escalated to a physical fight. The accused intervened trying to forcibly take the victim out of the car as he also did not agree with their destination,” Mpiti said. “Out of anger, Ngoasheng allegedly reached for the gun, alighted from the car and told the other ladies to move aside. That’s when he shot the victim in her right cheek." The accused apparently fled and later handed himself to the police.
