Aid agencies estimate about 73000 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar since violence erupted last week, Vivian Tan, regional spokeswoman for UN refugee agency UNHCR, said yesterday. Hundreds more refugees yesterday walked through rice paddies from the Naf river separating the two countries into Bangladesh, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities already helping tens of thousands. The clashes and military counter-offensive have killed nearly 400 people during the past week. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar’s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that violence against Muslims amounted to genocide. It marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October. “Islamic villagers in northern Maungtaw have been urged over loudspeakers to co-operate when security forces search for Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) extremist terrorists, and not to pose a threat or brandish weapons when security forces enter their villages,” the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said yesterday. Arsa has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government. The group claimed responsibility for attacks on security posts last week. In Maungni village in northern Rakhine, villagers last week caught two Arsa members and handed them over to the authorities. The army wrote in a Facebook post yesterday that Rohingya insurgents had set fire to monasteries, images of Buddha, schools and houses in northern Rakhine. More than 200 buildings, including shops, were destroyed across several villages, the army said. While Myanmar officials blamed Arsa, Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and human rights watchers say a campaign of arson and killings by the army is aimed at forcing the minority group out of the country. - Reuters
