Shikwambana said he could not give Malesela James Ngoasheng bail due to the gruesomeness of the offence, among other things presented to the court. Investigations officer Sergeant Jeremiah Mpiti said the 30-year-old man was described by neighbours as violent. He opposed bail as he feared Ngoasheng would interfere with the investigation and witnesses. Not only did the accused know the witnesses, his safety could also not guaranteed, Mpiti said. “Members of the community are angry over the incident." Despite the magistrate saying pictures could not be taken by the media, Ngoasheng's photograph had already gone viral on social media. "Looking at the comments, people are angered by the incident,” he said. Ledwaba’s family members said they knew justice would prevail. “We have confidence in the justice system. "We know justice will take its course. We are leaving everything in their hands in the hope that justice will prevail,” said Ledwaba’s father, Patrick Kgoale. However, Ngoasheng’s family said they were considering appealing against the denial of bail. Witnesses alleged Ngoasheng had shot Ledwaba because she had refused to go home with him after he bought her drinks at the nightclub. But investigations suggested the accused had got into an argument with the victim over where she wanted to be dropped off. The case is back in court on October 22.
