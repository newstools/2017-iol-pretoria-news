The Competition Commission on Tuesday said in a statement, the
charges stem from a probe into widespread anti-competitive conduct in the
market for the provision of transportation of motor vehicles, equipment
and machinery by sea to and from South Africa. Hoegh Autoliners Holdings AS (Hoegh) stands accused of
colluding with a Japanese car shipping company, Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd
(MOL). From around 2009, MOL and Hoegh engaged in prohibited
practices in that they agreed and/or engaged in concerted practices as
competitors to fix prices, divide markets and tender conclusively. Read also:  Stuttaford Van Lines charged for collusive tendering Among the charges are; collusive activities from around 1997
involving a tender issued by Auto Alliance Thailand to transport Mazda motor
vehicles from Thailand to South Africa and collusive activities from around
2004 involving tenders issued by Toyota South Africa to transport vehicles from
South Africa to Europe and North Africa; Sipho Ngwema commision’s spokesperson said MOL previously
approached the Commission in terms of its Corporate Leniency Policy and was
subsequently granted leniency for its involvement in the cartel conduct in
exchange for information and full cooperation in the matter. “In referring the matter against Hoegh to the Tribunal for
adjudication, the Commission is seeking an order declaring that the company is
liable for the payment of an administrative penalty equal to 10% of its annual
turnover on each of the charges.” - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
