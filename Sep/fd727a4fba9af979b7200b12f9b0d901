JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance in Madibeng on Monday said
it would monitor an investigation that was requested by the MPAC (Municipal
Public Accounts Committee) into seemingly irregular overtime payments in
Madibeng. This follows after three
officials, employed in the Executive Mayor, Jostina Mothipe's office, received
exorbitant overtime pay-outs after they allegedly worked an average of 12
hours overtime per day for a period of five months. In this latest scandal, the
three earned more than half a million Rand in
overtime money from November 2016 to March 2017. “They claimed they worked
232 hours overtime in January, resulting in a pay-out of R38 000 each. In
February the same three employees earned R27 000 each in overtime and in
March more than R30 000 each with 187 hours of overtime,” said DA. The party said none of them
were employed in essential services, but in the Mayor’s office.The ANC has lost
the plot a long time ago in Madibeng. This was just clear evidence of
mismanagement and irresponsible governance. “The executive mayor of
Madibeng is complicit in either fraud or serious mismanagement as evidenced by
the fact that three officials in her office apparently work 20 hours per day.
This is also in direct conflict with legislation in the Basic Conditions of
Employment Act”. “These officials are earning
hundreds of thousands of rands while Madibeng is choking in sewage and again it
proves that the Executive Mayor is not serious to stamp out fraud, corruption
and fruitless and wasteful expenditure,” said DA. The
DA said it would not stand for this and they would ensure that a proper
investigations takes place and that money that was earned irregularly was paid
back to the municipality. -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
