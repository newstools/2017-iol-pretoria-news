The event, in its sixth year, ushered in the warmer season. It saw people walk for 5km, 8km and 15km as well as the introduction of an 8km fun run. After walking a distance of their choice, participants received medals and got the chance to 
have some pictures taken of their achievement. Among them was 80-year-old 
Daniela Szalel, who walked for 5km and at the end still looked energetic. The second-time participant said she loved the event and definitely planned to be back next year. “The Spring Walk is always fun and I enjoy myself,” she said. First time entrant Caroline Mudau from Midrand said: “I did 8km and I really enjoyed the
experience... “I’m definitely coming back again next year. “I will be going for the 15km.” The event was fun for the whole family and promoted an active and healthy lifestyle. When they were done with the uphills and downhills, walkers were entertained by artists Dewald 
Wasserfall and Rubber Duc. A Spar kiddies area with plenty of children’s entertainment was also on hand to keep the young ones occupied. And sports enthusiasts had big television screens on which they watched the rugby  clash between Australia and the Springboks which ended in a 23-23 draw.
