symbolic for a number of reasons. BASCA was established at the request of
former president and hero, Nelson Mandela, who wished for Business against
Crime to join forces with the Government in eradicating crime. The symbolism of
BACSA being located a stone’s throw away from Nelson Mandela Square is undeniable”. Sandton City’s owners, Liberty Two Degrees, Liberty Group Limited
