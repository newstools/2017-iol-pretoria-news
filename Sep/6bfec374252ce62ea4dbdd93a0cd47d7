JOHANNESBURG - Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) has congratulated South African Breweries (SAB's) entrepreneurship campaign aimed at enabling South African entrepreneurs to create 10 000 jobs by 2021. The entrepreneurial campaign
brings together SAB’s initiatives under one integrated package and includes:
SAB KickStart focusing on youth entrepreneurship support; the SAB
Foundation that invests in entrepreneurs outside its value chain; SAB Thrive,
to invest and transform SAB’s suppliers; SAB Accelerator promoting black women entrepreneurship and
SAB’s agriculture initiatives that supports emerging farmers in the SAB supply
chain. The SAB programme -
providing a package of entrepreneurial support, was launched in Vilakazi
Street, Soweto on Monday. BUSA Chief Executive Officer
Tanya Cohen “Entrepreneurship is the backbone of any economy. In South Africa,
small businesses contribute only 65% to employment, relative to a
worldwide average of 95%.There is, therefore,significant scope to improve the
effectiveness of public and private support of emerging enterprises”. Cohen said that the SAB’s entrepreneurship initiative is
in line with BUSA’s approach to black economic empowerment and inclusive
economic growth. Read also: SAB to help create 1m jobs by 2030 BUSA identified
enterprise development as one of the key enablers in transformation of the South African economy
and growing employment opportunities. The potential to add many
small and growing businesses owned and controlled by young, black people is an
obvious avenue through which to activate inclusive economic growth. “Systemically supporting entrepreneurship opportunities
within SAB’s supply chain will make a meaningful contribution to enterprise
development and job creation - both of which are critical to transformation for
inclusive economic growth. It is, therefore, against this backdrop that BUSA welcomes andcongratulates
SAB on this initiative,” said  Cohen. -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
