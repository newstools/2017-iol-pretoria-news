ADEDY said the measures, which Greece plans to legislate in order to conclude a crucial review of its bailout progress, were “unfair and tough”. An official at private sector union GSEE, Greece’s largest, said it is also gearing for a 24-hour walkout on May 17. Its board would confirm the decision next week, the official said. The date of the strike, aimed to coincide with the parliamentary vote on the measures, could change, ADEDY said.
