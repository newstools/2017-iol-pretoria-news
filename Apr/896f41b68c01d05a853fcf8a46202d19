Pretoria â€“ President Jacob Zuma said the Presidency would fulfill the late Ontlametse Phalatse's wish and build a house for her family. Zuma was speaking at her funeral in Hebron where hundreds are gathered to pay their last respects. "I felt like we had to do something after we met with her last month. Without any fear she (Ontlametse) said she wanted me to build her family a proper house, because the one they live in is slowly dilapidating," said Zuma. In addition Zuma also gave the family a car which was also on Ontlametse's wish list.  Ontlametse was a well-known motivational speaker who suffered from progeria, a genetic disorder which causes rapid ageing.  Doctors did not think Phalatse would live to see her 14th birthday, but on March 25 she turned 18 after finishing her matric. She died last week at the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital after experiencing breathing problems. Pretoria News
