Asian Trekking agency official Madhav Basnet said 21-year-old Liang Sheng Yueh was found on Wednesday on a ledge under a waterfall and was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the capital, Kathmandu. He said the body of his girlfriend, 19-year-old Liu Chen Chun, was also taken to the capital. They were on a long trek on the Ganesh Himal trail, which is not as crowded as other popular routes, and were caught in a snowstorm last month and lost their way. According to Basnet, they appeared to have followed a river hoping to find a village but slipped and fell over a waterfall. They landed on the ledge and were unable to climb up or down. The area is at an altitude of 2600 metres. Basnet said the weather improved a few days after the snowstorm, but the temperature was unclear. They had no guides or porters and were carrying their own food, tent and sleeping bags. For the first two weeks they survived on food they had in their backpacks but after that they consumed only salt and water, he said. Rescuers first scoured the area for two weeks before suspending their search, but resumed the search on April20. Basnet said they spotted a red tent and managed to climb down, and then winched the man up by helicopter. - AP
