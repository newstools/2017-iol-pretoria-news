Pretoria â€“ The late Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada was on Wednesday evening honoured in the first of the four public memorial services in Pretoria.          During his funeral last Wednesday various ministers stood in solidarity with Kathrada's position and his family in their unwavering support of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan who was fired by President Jacob Zuma in his cabinet reshuffle last Thursday. Last year, after Zuma fired former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene and replaced him with a relatively unknown Des van Rooyen, Kathrada addressed a letter to Zuma asking him to step down. It was revealed by Former President Kgalema Motlanthe during Kathrada's funeral last week that the letter went unanswered by Zuma. The funeral, in addition to honouring Kathrada's iconic legacy, served as a meeting place to renew the call for Zuma to step down. Pretoria News
