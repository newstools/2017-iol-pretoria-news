The loss of visitors would put 10000 jobs at risk, the Australia-based Climate Council said in a new report released in Brisbane. “Over the next two to three decades, bleaching events are likely to become even more frequent and severe in Australia, with catastrophic impacts on reef health and the economy,” the report said. The Unesco World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is one of the top two tourist attractions in the country. It currently generates Aus$7bn in income per year and supports 70000 Australians employed in sectors such as tourism, according to the Climate Council. “This isn't just an environmental issue. The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia's greatest economic assets,” ecologist Lesley Hughes said. Last year, the Great Barrier Reef - experienced its worst bleaching event in history. Ninety percent of the reef's coral was bleached, and more than 20% of the reef's coral died. - dpa
