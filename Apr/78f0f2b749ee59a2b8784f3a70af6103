Peter Mathebula, a guard at the centre, thought he recognised the shopper's vehicle as the getaway car of a man who had robbed a bank a few months earlier. He called police. When the officers arrived, he described the man he had seen go into Woolworths, and it was there that Bulali Mdontsane, a chemical engineer, was arrested and taken to the Garsfontein police station and held for four days. Mdontsane claimed R500 000 from the police for damages, and on Friday the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, awarded him R350 000. Warrant Officer Peter Maharela testified that he had rushed to Lynnwood Bridge when he received a call about the man who had allegedly robbed a bank six months earlier. Mdontsane testified he had been in Woolworths buying food and looking for a gift for a colleague when three policemen confronted him, saying he was a suspect in a bank robbery. He went with them to his car, where a security guard he had never seen before accused him of being the robber. Despite his explanation that he worked for BP South Africa, even producing a business card, he was pushed roughly into a police van. He said he had been placed in a smelly cell with toilets that did not work and filthy blankets. After his release he had to spend a week at home recovering from his ordeal. Acting Judge A H Petersen said Mdontsane had been humiliated. “I accept that a man of his standing had to endure the stigma attached to his arrest from various quarters, including his workplace,” he said.
