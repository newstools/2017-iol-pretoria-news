Pretoria â€“ Traffic in the Pretoria CBD is moving slowly as a group of EFF supporters run amok in the streets, singing the anti-Jacob Zuma songs. Marchers have braved the rainy weather to throng through Paul Kruger, Madiba, Thabo Sehume streets, Francis Baard and Pretorius streets. Carrying sticks, knobkerries and vuvuzelas, they continue to sing Struggle songs. They are part of the National Day of Action march spearheaded by opposition political parties to pressure Zuma to call it quits.   Many shops and banks in most of the streets are closed for safety and workers are standing up outside. Some people are standing by to view the marchers and taking pictures using their cellphones.
