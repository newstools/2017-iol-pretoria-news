 GAUTENG High Court, Pretoria, Judge Andre Louw passed away over the weekend after he had shot himself at his Cullinan smallholding, east of Pretoria.
The police was called after his body was discovered on Sunday morning inside his house by a friend who lived nearby.
Judge Louw, 59, was for a long time involved in Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) while he was an advocate. 
LHR lawyer Louise du Plessis, who was a close friend of Judge Louw, said he was known as an intelligent and insightful lawyer,  advocate and  judge.
“He loved nature and lived the last few years on a small farm outside Cullinan, with beautiful surroundings. Andre liked to keep things simple . He did not own a TV, but preferred to rather read, especially poetry.”
Judge Louw was admitted as an advocate on August 4, 1987 and began practising at the Pretoria Bar on the same day. He received his Silk status in January 2004 and on March 1, 2009, he took his place on the Bench as a judge.
He leaves three children behind, Elna, Adam and Sebella.
