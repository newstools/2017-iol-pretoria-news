Court proceedings could not resume due to other matters being heard, which led to prosecutor Bongani Chauke having no choice but to ask for the matter to be postponed as the court hours had been exhausted. Moshabane sat untidily dressed in the dock in a grey jersey, black pants and a black scarf around her neck. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) Serious Commercial Crimes Unit in Johannesburg arrested Moshabane, 42, on Tuesday at the MTN headquarters in Fairland on fraud and theft charges. Moshabane has been working for MTN for more than 13 years. It is alleged that she fraudulently transferred money from the MTN bank account into her personal bank account for the period between July 16, 2015, and April 4, 2017. The bank contacted MTN management about suspicious transactions made into one of their employeeâ€™s personal bank accounts. Further investigations revealed that the account number belonged to Moshabane. The matter will be back in court on Friday. AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
