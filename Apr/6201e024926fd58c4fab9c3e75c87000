Johannesburg - South Africa's rand eased
back early on Friday, ending a recent rally that has lifted the
unit to 3 week high as developed market currencies came back in
favour. At 0650 GMT the rand was little changed, trading
0.04 percent weaker at $13 1550 per  compared to a close of
13.1500 overnight in New York. Yield-hungry investors have ignored the political fallout
and two credit downgrades to "junk" that followed President
Jacob Zuma's sudden firing of his finance minister in late
March. Read also: Rand in biggest slide since 2015 Local unit also facing selling pressure as dollar and euro

securities exchange's Top-40 futures index up 0.46
percent. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government
bond due in 2026 rose 1 basis points to 8.68 percent. REUTERS
