Jurgem Buchelt, 51, of Goodwood said close to one thousand motorbikers rode from N1 City to Parliament for the Zuma protests."There are more coming... this is only half of the bikers now." They made their way through protesters who are marching from Keizersgracht Street to Parliament.One protester Hazel Jeftha, 51, from Belhar said: "It's a form of protest for us as the individuals. What's happening in Parliament is not reflective of what we are saying on the ground."Asanda Ndlebe, 25, Delft said, "Zuma must just go!" We want to play our part to save SA. And we believe one of the ways of doing this is if this man falls."The bikers gave a colourful display revving their huge machines, while people cheered on.   In Pretoria thousands of people came together, branding placards and singing and joining hands. All had the same message for President Zuma: That it was time for him to step down.Reverent Kenneth Meshoe from African Christian Democratic Party, who joined the march, said he will march up to the Union Buildings in solidarity with the Save SA movement.“Our weapons are our voices.
