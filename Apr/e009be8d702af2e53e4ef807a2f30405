Johannesburg – South African Airways (SAA) cabin crew have
gone on strike over international meal allowances. Speaking on 702 this morning, the spokesperson for the South
African Cabin Crew Association said the crew had not had an international meal
allowance increase in six years. The crew want the daily allowance raised from $131 for
all three meals to $170 a day, although the crew is open to negotiation, the
spokesperson says. Late on Tuesday, the airline notified customers and
stakeholders that the airline has been served with a notice of intention to
embark on an industrial action by one of the labour unions representing its
cabin crew members, the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA). The
notification states that an industrial action will commence on Wednesday
morning. It says the airline is doing everything possible to find
common ground and/or a settlement on matters that are currently under
discussion. “Negotiations are ongoing and the company remains optimistic that
the strike action could be averted.” Read also: SAA and Hawaiian Airlines strike deal It adds preparations are underway to support any service
disruptions. It explains the unintended impacts of the service
disruption may result in an adverse effect on the operations schedule and

crew, and it represents more than 80 percent of all crew – which will see
flights grounded. “The airline will ensure that all changes are published
timeously and day of travel support will be provided to customers who may
experience flight delays or cancellations that may occur during this period,”
SAA says. BUSINESS REPORT
