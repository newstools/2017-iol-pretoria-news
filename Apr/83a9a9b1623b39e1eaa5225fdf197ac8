Nairobi - Kenya's year-on-year inflation
rose to 11.48 percent in April from 10.28 percent
last month, on the back of higher prices of food, the statistics
office said on Friday. The rate first rose outside of the government's preferred
band of 2.5 - 7.5 percent in February, after food prices surged
due to a drought, which left about 2.7 million people in need of
food aid.April's rate of inflation is the highest since May 2012. Month-on-month inflation increased to 1.79 percent from 1.67
percent last month. Policymakers held the benchmark lending rate
at 10.0 percent last month saying they expected inflation to
fall in line soon. Prices of vegetables, maize flour and maize grains rose
during the month, the statistics office said. Read also:Â Companies are more confident REUTERS
