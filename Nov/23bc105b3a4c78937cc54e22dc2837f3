Pretoria - As the bereaved families await a report into the deaths of their five children in Soshanguve after an overhead light collapse, Energy Minister David Mahlobo is visiting the area. The incident, which took place in Ward 27 on Saturday afternoon, appeared to have been caused due to tampering with cables, possibly with criminal intent. Four of the children died on the scene and the fifth died in hospital. Mahlobo who was accompanied by Gauteng MEC of Infrastructure Jacob Mamabolo, described the incident as shocking and heartbreaking. “It’s always sad when parents have to bury the offspring, especially at such a tender age. The families loss also impacts us because these young children could have been future leaders in the country, but there lives were cut short,” he said. "It is unfortunate that this vandalisation of electricity wires has terminated the lives of innocent souls," he added. The incident has been reported to police and an inquest docket opened.
