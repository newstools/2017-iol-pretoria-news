This was revealed by Home Affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni, presenting a progress report on the application process for the new permits in Pretoria on Friday. He said the permits system started in 2014 and had been issued to 197941 applicants in the past three years. The permits expire on December 31 and holders are advised to submit applications online through the VFS Global website. Apleni said that to date, 169078 
holders had completed their 
applications online while 135913 already scheduled their appointments for the required submission of fingerprints and supporting documents. “A total of 72612 applicants have completed the entire process. “The process includes honouring their appointments with VFS as well as submitting 
their supporting documents and
biometrics. Apleni said that owing to the large number of permit holders who have completed the online applications so 
far, the department extended the closing date for submission of supporting documents and biometrics to January 31. He said that by the end of September 2018, the department should have completed the whole project, including finalising adjudications and issuing the new permits. “We want to emphasise that 
the November 30 (deadline) is only for the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit. The extension up to January 31 is only for scheduling appointments for biometrics and supporting documents.”
