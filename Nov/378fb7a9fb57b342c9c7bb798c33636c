matlhatsi.dibakwane@inl.co.za The US Embassy in Pretoria, the City of Tshwane, and WeConnect International in South Africa partnered to present the “Women in Business: Connect Session” at the Es’kia Mphahlele Community Library. The event is to provide valuable information to women business owners and entrepreneurs seeking to grow their businesses and professional networks. The sessions focused on women doing business in Tshwane to market opportunities for female entrepreneurs, to give legal and human resources advice, customer service and project management tips. The city women will be trained on how to perfect their business pitching, and will thereafter pitch their businesses in 30 seconds. Mayoral committee member Mare-lise Fourie encouraged the women in business to thrive to be the best, and added that she was tired of women being given positions because of quotas.
  
"We really need to start buying from each other, buy from women businesses. "We are not competition, we are each others strength," said the executive director of WeConnect International South Africa Jean Chawapiwa.
