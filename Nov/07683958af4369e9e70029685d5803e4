The beautiful creations are hard to miss as they are in Nellmapius Drive and Olifantsfontein Road in Centurion, close by the Rietvlei Nature Reserve. Driving past them, one would think the animals and the baobab trees were real as they are literally the size of real-life animals, while the baobab trees come in different shapes, sizes and colours. The animals are made of metal sheets and the baobab trees of steel wire. The animal menagerie includes some of the Big Five, such as the rhino, elephant and buffalo, as well as other species including kudu. The artist making the sculptures is 34-year-old Dingiswayo Ziba from Ga-Rankuwa. Ziba specialises in making upside-down trees and all things wood. Brothers Kudakwashe and Propergate Mutava are the men behind the wire baobab trees and the animals built of metal sheets. With the festive season approaching, Kudakwashe said wire baobab trees made outstanding African Christmas trees. The trio said that before they moved to the area there was not much happening there. It was full of dirt and not safe for passers-by at night. They decided to clean up the area and use it as a place to sell their African artworks. And being proud African men they chose to make African artwork. Unlike the Mutava brothers who studied art at school, Ziba learnt the skill from other people. “I've always loved art but never had the opportunity to go to school and study it," Ziba said. "But, as a hustler, I found ways to learn through other people and grabbed the opportunity when it presented itself," he said. “This spot works in our favour because it's right next to the Riet-
vlei Nature Reserve. "So tourists are in for a treat as they can literally take an elephant or rhino home,” quipped Kudakwashe.
