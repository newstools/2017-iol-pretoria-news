Rudzani Matshili Civil rights organisation AfriForum’s CEO Kallie Kriel said AfriForum will privately prosecute advocate Nomgcibo Jiba on charges of fraud, perjury and defeating the ends of justice. Kriel made the announcement to the media on Thursday at the AfriForum building in Centurion. Jiba becomes the second person AfriForum announced would be hauled before the prosecuting unit. The charges relate to Jiba’s decision to prosecute Johan Booysen on charges of racketeering. Her decision was set aside by the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban. In a short advisory issued this week on behalf of the organisation, it was stated that the person to be announced was “very prominent in President Jacob Zuma's inner circle".

Kriel said despite damning court rulings against Jiba, the NPA refuses to act against her. Jiba is also mentioned in Jacques Pauw’s new book The President's Keepers as one of the “keepers ” who find themselves in President Zuma’s inner circle. Last month, head of the organisation’s private prosecuting team Gerrie Nel announced that Duduzane Zuma would be the first person to be privately prosecuted. Three years ago Duduzane Zuma crashed his Porsche into a taxi transporting Phumzile Dube in Johannesburg. It was also announced that he would assist a Johannesburg model Gabrielle Engels, who accused Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe for assaulting her.
