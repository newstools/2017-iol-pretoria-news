However, for Pretoria, it will take yet another season to overcome the capital’s bad omen of not having produced an Idols winner. The city’s hopeful, Botlhale Phora, sang his first single titled Good Enough. With a good fusion of IsiZulu and English, it was hard to believe we were really hearing this song for the first time. The Ga-Rankuwa boy’s #TeamBotlhale clearly didn’t give him enough votes to secure him a top two spot. Judge Randall Abrahams said: I can’t see your career stopping here even if you don’t win this season.” Then the audience got to hear Mthokozisi’s brand new single, Masithandane. It was so beautiful that it had the judges and the entire audience at the Pretoria State Theatre giving him a standing ovation. Paxton, Cape Town’s hope, performed her new single Demonstrate and it did give a new sound well befitting of a teenager who is super talented. “You deserve everything that is coming your way,” said Randall. Judge Somizi Mhlongo added: “I am not your target market since I am 75, but it’s a good song for that market.” The voting lines are open and it is now a battle between Paxton’s team of supporters and Mthokozisi’s followers. No amount of singing at this point of the competition can change a lot of people’s minds. It’s a stage where everybody has identified their favourite. Six days left, and Idols SA will be closing down the curtains for the year 2017. Voting is extended until this Thursday at 10pm. Carnival City will host the finale on Sunday.
