As the official custodian of the national brand, Brand South Africa promotes social activism in order to get citizens to advocate against social ills such as child abuse. The campaign aims to lift the spirit of the nation by inspiring all South Africans to contribute to positive change. Every year on November 20, the world commemorates Universal Children’s Day, a day which offers an inspirational entry point to promote and celebrate children’s rights, translating into dialogues and actions that will build a better world for them. “This Universal Children’s Day, let us be inspired to protect and promote children’s rights. "Brand South Africa’s campaign aims to further increase awareness and mobilise all sectors of the society to nurture, care and protect its children in order to build a better future for them," says Brand South Africa’s GM marketing, Sithembile Ntombela. Captain Skhokho encourages children to report the abuser and to speak out when in need of help. “The future of the country is in the hands of our children and it is entirely up to civil society, government and business to safeguard our children. "Their rights are enshrined in the constitution and, as a society, it is our duty to uphold and protect these rights for our children. "As Nelson Mandela once said: 'There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children',” adds Ntombela. In support of the campaign, Brand South Africa has called on all citizens to participate, pledge and share their insights about what this day means to them and how they are playing their part in protecting children. - Brand South Africa
