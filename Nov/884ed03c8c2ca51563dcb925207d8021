She said this during a joint media conference regarding farm murders and to make a plea to the government to intervene and prioritise the farm murder crisis. The conference held at the AfriForum offices in Centurion saw organisations such as the Democratic Alliance, Congress of the People (Cope), Freedom Front Plus, Solidarity and Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU SA) unite against farm murders.

"However, in rural areas it is a totally different dynamic, not only are we looking at people who feed the nation but we are talking about one farmer feeding around 2 000 people and every time that farmer is murdered it means there are 2 000 people looking for food elsewhere,” she said. She alleged that members of the SAPS do not have many cases of farm attacks but instead performed a tick box exercise. She said this was due to under-resourcing police stations in rural areas. “When you ask how many of the members are on the field you get responses saying they only have one working police vehicle.” The organisations also committed themselves to participate in a protest march against farm murders that is being planned for Saturday November 25. They will march from the Pretoria Art Museum to the Union Buildings to hand a memorandum.
