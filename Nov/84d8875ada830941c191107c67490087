A warrant of arrest has been issued against Mongalo Mongale, who is on the run for crimes she allegedly committed last year. According to police spokesperson Matthew Nkoadi, her modus operandi included impersonating the owners of houses as well as pretending to be an estate agent and selling houses that belonged to other people. She allegedly sold them to unsuspecting desperate home seekers under false pretences, he said. Nkoadi said more than a dozen victims had fallen prey to the woman, who operated in and around Hammanskraal, Soshanguve, Ga-Rankuwa, Orchards and other areas. Meanwhile, in the east of the city, police were yesterday entangled in a shootout with three criminals who tried to steal a Toyota Corolla at a church in Milner Street, Waterkloof at about 10.30am. Hi-Risk Security - part of the Brooklyn Security Forum - responded first to the scene. Security personnel caught four suspects in the act and tried to intervene. However, one of the suspects pointed a firearm at them. The security guards responded by shooting at the suspects, who drove away in their getaway car, also a Toyota Corolla. They also shot at the Brooklyn security officers who joined in the chase. The suspects lost control of their vehicle in Clark Street, a few blocks away from the church. Three suspects were immediately arrested by the police and the security guards on the scene. One suspect sustained a gunshot wound and received medical treatment before being taken to a local hospital. The fourth suspect managed to escape. Car-breaking implements were found inside the vehicle that was used by the suspects. The trio, from Mamelodi East, are all in their 30s and will appear in the Hatfield Community Court soon on charges of attempted theft of a motor vehicle, possession of car-breaking implements and attempted murder.
