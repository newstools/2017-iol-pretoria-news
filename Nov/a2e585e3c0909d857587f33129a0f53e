Volcanic ash reaching 7 600m into the air began drifting south and south-east of Mount Agung, leaving clean space above the airport for planes to land and take off, said an airport spokesman. The airport, which handles more than 400 flights a day, had closed on Monday, disrupting travel for tens of thousands of people trying to enter or leave the popular vacation destination. Thick ash particles are hazardous to aircraft and can seize engines. Despite the all-clear from authorities, flights are unlikely to rapidly return to normal levels and a change in the direction of the ash or a new more powerful eruption could force the airport’s closure again. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo ordered all concerned ministries and agencies, as well as the military and police, to help Bali’s government deal with the disaster. Authorities have told 100 000 people to leave an area extending up to 10km in places from the volcano as it belched grey and white plumes. - AP
