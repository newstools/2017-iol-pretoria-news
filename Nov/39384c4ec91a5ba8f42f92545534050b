Pretoria - Security guards at Steve Biko Hospital have threatened to shut down the hospital if their salaries are not paid by end of business today. More than 200 unpaid guards this morning barricaded the hospital’s entrances with rocks, burning tyres and rubble. By the time the Pretoria News arrived, calm had already been restored. The guards said they were striking due to their payments being delayed and some not getting paid at all. Academic Professional Staff Association's (APSA) shop steward, Bernard Matsekoleng representing the workers said: “Most of the officers did not receive their salaries on the 15th, so we went to the company's offices to find out why people were not paid but the gates were closed, our calls are not answered and emails we send bounce back so that's why we are here striking.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

No one will go in or out,” Matsekoleng said. Acting head of the hospital, Mathabo Mathebula said the strike had slightly affected the hospital’s operations. “One or two ambulances had to use a different entrance. Patients were not turned away because they need services but some of them had to walk a longer distance as the access for cars was blocked. "We used golf carts to fetch them from wherever they were dropped off.” Mathebula said there was a team of guards sent by the same company to protect the hospital. There is no threat to the safety of patients or the hospital property, she said. Pretoria News
