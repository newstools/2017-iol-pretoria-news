rapula.moatshe@inl.co.za Ex-mayor of Emfuleni Municipality Simon Mofokeng, who recently resigned amid a semi-naked picture scandal involving a 14-year-old girl, was labelled a "digital WhatsApp sex predator". Leader of DA Women's Network in Gauteng Moipone Molotlhanyi, chastised Mofokeng for his sexual behavior during a march against child and women abuse in Pretoria yesterday. Mofokeng had reportedly sent a teenage girl picture to a WhatsAPP group of ANC leaders named “festival of Ideas”. Molotlhanyi said: "We are well aware of the mayor there in Emfuleni who I call a digital WhatsApp predator, who has scarred a 14-year old girl for life."

The disgraced mayor was placed on special leave by the ANC following allegations of sexually grooming a teenage girl, but he subsequently resigned. Molotlhanyi said people had grown impatient of the ANC, which can't act against those in powerful political politicians. Marchers spoke up against the scourge of abuse faced by children, women and people living with diabilities as part of the 16 days of activism campaign. They marched from Princess Park to Pretoria Central Police Station, where they called for police to act against all forms of abuse inflicted upon those who could not defend themselves.
