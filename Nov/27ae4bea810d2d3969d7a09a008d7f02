These were the words of Poppie van der Merwe’s biological father, Christo van der Merwe, while he attended court proceedings with his wife Lulu and other family members. They all wore pictures of the angelic-looking blonde girl pinned to their clothes. Van der Merwe said it was very difficult to sit through the proceedings, but they were there for “all the Poppies in the world” out there, who could not speak for themselves. He referred to Monday’s court proceedings during which Judge Bert Bam angrily commented that it appeared that nobody did anything to officially assist the child. It appeared that everyone kicked the ball back to the other. Van der Merwe on Wednesday said it was clear that there should not only be two accused before court, as many more had failed his daughter.
