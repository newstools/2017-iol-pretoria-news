That’s why I want this to be a kid’s haven, not a children’s home. That’s why we brought in colour.” Funded by the PPG with a donation of R435 000, the remodeling of the children’s home features 20 rooms, each at a two person occupancy. Some of the new amenities feature classrooms where the students have classes in the morning and are taught valuable life skills. On Wednesday, they will officially open a skills training computer hub that will provide them with a curriculum for computer skills.
