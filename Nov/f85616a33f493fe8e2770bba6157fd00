Invited to the event were Grade 11 and 12 pupils and their parents and others who had interest and passion for hospitality. Guests were served scrumptious dishes prepared by students at the academy. Different stations representing different countries were set, where students demonstrated how the meals were prepared. One of the meals was a sage with gnocchi and parmesan cheese prepared by chef Thapelo Butjie, a first-year student at the academy. Chef Butjie first burned butter with sage, then added gnocchi after boiling it in hot water with pepper. He then added parmesan cheese and then flambéed the gnocchi with burned butter. Danica Schneider, 17, a Grade 11 pupil from High School Oos Moot, said she would be going to the academy after matric. “I have great passion for cooking and making delicious treats. I came up with my own pancake dish and the teacher went crazy about it so that’s how I realised my passions.” Academy spokesperson Cecile Boshoff said: “The open day is important because the students can experience and get a taste of what it would be like. And the parents get to ask all the technical questions like financial questions, transport, when the classes would be and the structure of the year.”
