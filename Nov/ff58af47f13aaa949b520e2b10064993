The former maths teacher and headmaster of Hillview High School is an editor and writer of The Glenhaven Globe. The magazine tells stories of residents at the Glenhaven Retirement Centre in Garsfontein, Pretoria; where he also lives. Just like any normal magazine, the Globe has a lead story, new cover page every time it's published, entertainment, information and more. Birthdays, newcomers, jokes sections and more are covered in the 16-page magazine. Its centre part has a calendar that informs people about activities and events for the month. Once a month, McDougall and his team of five inform elders at the complex cost-free. Every first Monday of the month copies are put in their post boxes. He said through the stories published, unity was created among themselves. “Through the magazine people are held together. It is a magazine for the people. Everything in here has something to do with somebody here. And because it goes to the people, they look forward to it.” McDougall said it was through teamwork that the magazine ran successfully. “I have people who are my sub-editors and if I put a comma in the wrong place they tell me and they are very good,” he said. Originally, The Glenhaven Globe was just one page printed on both sides but when the editor took over in 2014 he revamped it. “It had only one page printed on two sides but I wanted a proper magazine,” McDougall said. He said he was proud of the reception it has had since. “It is getting to be very popular. So if it’s one day late they are all on my back. The centre part of it is the most important because the people use the calendar to check events. “There are also things I put in the magazine just to cheer them up.” - Rudzani Matshili
