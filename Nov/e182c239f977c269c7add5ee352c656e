Pretoria - Hundreds of men and women in blue have converged at the Tshwane Police Academy for the ceremony to bestow the sword of command to newly appointed police commissioner General Khehla Sithole. Minister of of police Fikile Mbalula will preside over the ceremony. President Jacob Zuma was meant to show face but cancelled at the 11th hour. Mbalula said the sword symbolises righteousness and justice. It obliges Sitole to serve the country with loyalty, courage, dignity and honour. “I have no doubt he will abide by the rules and lead the men and women in blue,” he said. Zuma appointed Sithole, as the national police commissioner with immediate effect last Wednesday. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The post had been a hard one to fill after former national police commissioner Riah Phiyega was suspended on full pay in 2015. In June the contract of acting national commissioner Lt Gen Khomotso Phahlane lapsed, that’s when Zuma appointed Lt-Gen Lesetja Mothiba to act. Born in Standerton in Mpumalanga province, Gen Sitole brings a wealth of operational as well as management experience to the SAPS.
Zuma has extended his gratitude and appreciation to Lt-Gen Lesetja Mothiba who has been acting as the national commissioner for almost five years. Pretoria News
