VIRGILATTE GWANGWA THE University of Pretoria holds its 5th annual African disability rights conference focusing on the implications of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) with reference to the right to equal recognition before the law. The conference is taking place at the St George hotel in Irene and disabled people have gathered from across the African continent to discuss challenges they face within the justice system. "For one to access or have access to the justice system you first need to be recognised as a human being. "And if you are not recognised as a person before the law, that is when there will be barriers for people to access the system," said Boaz Muhumuza of the open society initiative of East Africa. He said there were lots of challenges people with disabilities faced because the justice system does not cater for them. For instance, he mentioned that for one to fill in an affidavit in East Africa they must first declare they were of a sound mind, but the clause did not clearly state what it meant by a sound mind. The conference is a two days programme running from today until tomorrow.
