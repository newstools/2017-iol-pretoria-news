The residents will soon launch a new concept to preserve and clean up their environment. Ward councillor Roelof Fourie said there was a desperate need for the clean-up. Pavements and bridges had weeds growing from them, which gave the neighbourhood an untidy, careless look. He admitted that it was going to take the City a long time to have enough money to do everything they needed - least of all to root out weeds from pavements. “We need to start doing things for ourselves and not wait on the metro. We should start taking responsibility and clean up our neighbourhoods,” he said. The concept, coined My City Hour, is the brainchild of former councillor Rita Aucamp. It will kick off before the end of the year. Fourie said the idea behind the concept was to get every resident to jump in and help clean up. It entails every resident cleaning the portion of their property fronting the street. “An ordinary worker works for about R25 per hour,” said Fourie. “If every resident gives only one hour a month of their time, it means we’ll save R25 per person every month.” He said the metro simply did not have enough equipment to deal with it all. “There is a record in our register that there should be a certain number of equipment, but many just disappeared without trace,” he said. Weeds were unsightly and spoilt neatly-tended flower beds and borders, yards and driveways, he said. “There are lots of ways to deal with them, either with chemicals or in a natural, environmentally friendly way, by mechanical means or with household chemicals. “At the moment people are producing more refuse than the metro can keep cleaning, and this is not even talking about overgrown open areas.” Fourie encourages all residents in his ward to be part of this concept to be launched  in December.
