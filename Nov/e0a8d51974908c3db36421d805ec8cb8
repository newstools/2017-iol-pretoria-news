Their aim is to challenge the country’s big three parties in the 2019 national elections. The new party’s official launch is scheduled for next year, Khoza revealed 
yesterday. Khoza said the party had “a lot of comrades who are coming from the ANC”, while others would join the party from the DA and the EFF with the United Front of Civics and the Forum 4 Service Delivery already on board. She also said there were members of the NFP who would be joining her new venture. Khoza said the new party was not an ANC breakaway party, but a merger between several political parties. “You’re going to see prominent leaders of the EFF who were part of the founding of the EFF, leaders who were office bearers, who are going to be part of this,” Khoza said. These formations were merging, she said, because they had seen South Africa fragmenting, while their aim was to unite the country. “We are going to be the leader of society and we are not necessarily hostile to the ANC. The ANC has fulfilled its mission and it must give the younger generation the opportunity to run the country,” Khoza said. It was time for the ANC to hand over the reins to people who "have a high moral stamina and who are ethical” and who can take South Africa to the next level, she said. On what the new party would do differently to the ruling party, Khoza said: “We have a lot of new blood. The ANC has developed a tendency of keeping all the people from 1994 as ministers who are not able to shift.” She said they would be taking everything good from the ANC and discard everything bad about the party. “We’re taking the moral value system of Anton Lembede, we’re taking the spirit of Charlotte Maxeke with us.
