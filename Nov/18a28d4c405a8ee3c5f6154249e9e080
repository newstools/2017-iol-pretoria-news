The artist from Hammanskraal is the brains behind the dance moves and costumes that millions of viewers and guests will see at the extravaganza on Sunday. After a three-year run in Mangaung, the awards are back in Gauteng and will be held at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park at 8pm. World championship gold medallists Wayde van Niekerk, Caster Semenya and Luvo Manyonga have been nominated for the Sports Star of the Year. At least 18 categories will be contested including Sportsman of the Year Sports Star of the Year Sportswoman of the Year Sportswoman of the Year with a Disability Newcomer of the Year and Team of the Year. For Modjadji, the opportunity forms part of his career highlights. “I felt so honoured when I got the news I was literally screaming with joy. “I’m grateful to my country for recognising my talent and giving me opportunities to showcase my talent because finding work at home can be hard,” he said. “People must expect magic. This is such an amazing platform for me. I’ve had the opportunity to work at the Gauteng Sports Awards and am excited to finally (be able) to bring sports and dance together at the SA Sports Awards.” Modjadji added that, through his work, people in sport would be appreciated for their contribution. “I look forward to showcasing the power and strength of dance and literally just to celebrate our athletes. "I hope that when they look on stage they are able to recognise themselves in the work we are putting on stage, their grace, strength and their discipline.” Modjadji is a recipient of former US president Barack Obama’s Mandela Washington Young Leaders Award and a Global Young Leaders Award recipient, and has been recognised internationally for his philanthropic work at home and abroad.
