Thousands of shoppers went to their nearest malls and shopping centres as early as 5am today while some stores only opened at 7am. They said it was important for one to get to the malls early as it was the only way they could get what they wanted. And entering the stores meant pushing and shoving each other and racing to the shelves. Once inside the shops, it was just matter of seconds that shelves, where items were sold at lower prices, were emptied. Most food items and baby products were bought in bulk leading to shoppers pulling more than one trolley. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

One of the shoppers, Patrick Hlaole was one of the shoppers who bought in bulk at Soshanguve Crossing. Hlaole said he got to the mall at 6am but found people already queuing outside. Among the items he had bought, were four packs of disposable nappies for his 7-month-old baby which he said would last him till February as there were other packets already at his house. "I have to buy these things in bulk because this special only comes once a year so I have to take this opportunity," he said. Black Friday is originally an American retail promotion that takes place on the last Friday of November after the American Thanksgiving holiday which originated in the 1950s. South African retailers recently adapted the culture which they have added to their own retail calender.
