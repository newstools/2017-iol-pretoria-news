The festival will be launched with the opening night of Isambulo tomorrow. The show runs until December 23. Mabena said the play was more about experience and memories than anything else. He said many people would relate to the show as it was about a typical Sunday church service.   “Isambulo displays the African culture of worship within a typical Sunday church service.  "It's a clear dramatisation of what you would find in different South African churches.  “It doesn't matter whether one is Methodist, Christian or Catholic; everyone will relate to the storyline as we have fused the sounds of different denominations,” Mabena said. He said the show reached out to everyone regardless of age, race or denomination.  Although the show displayed a church service, it was not only restricted to churchgoers.  “It is for everyone, churchgoer or not. At some point you were obliged to go to church or Sunday school by your parents and, with the show, 
you will recognise some characters you once saw when you were at church.  “That is what Isambulo is about, bringing back the memories,” he said.   Mabena said city dwellers should brace themselves for a spectacular show as they were ready to give them a good show and beyond. The show features some of the country’s well-known professional musicians and actors, such as SABC2's I want to sing Gospel winner Nhlakanipho Cele, Simphiwe Mini, Busisiwe Sibiya and Mathapelo Masilela. Theatre spokesperson Thakgatso Setseta said the musical left audiences in awe and begging for more when they were afforded a two-night teaser performance last year.  It was due to an urgency to relive musicals that the theatre has now assured audiences of a full season throughout the Mzansi Fela Festival ending on December 23. The festival’s line-up also features Thandiswa Mazwai's live perfomance on December 8, with legendary jazz couple Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu on December 17. Tickets are available from
