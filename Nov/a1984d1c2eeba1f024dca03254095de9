Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange gave a grim account of the number of crimes committed in the province from April 1, 2016 to March 17, 2017. She was giving an overview of the best and worst stations in every municipality in terms of contact crimes, which included murder, sexual offences, assault, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, robbery, and robbery with aggravating circumstances. The report included statistics of carjackings and thefts, robbery at residential premises, cases of arson and malicious damage to property, as well as property and commercial-related crimes. The statistics revealed that Akasia, Mamelodi East and Olievenhoutbosch had seen an increase in reported contact crimes when compared to the 2015/16 statistics. Akasia had a 14% increase in contact crimes, from 1792 to 2043, Mamelodi East increased by 7.6% from 2207 to 2374, and an 11.5% increase was reported in Olievenhoutbosch, which had 1357 during the previous year. Accordingly, Temba and Pretoria West were ranked as the most improved, with Temba coming in with a 5.2% decrease and Pretoria West with a 12.2% decrease in contact crimes. Murder reportedly spiked by 81.1% in Olievenhoutbosch, and an astonishing 190.0% in Erasmia. Wierdabrug was, however, reported as the only area to have reported a decrease in murders, by 90.9%. De Lange detailed how Hammanskraal had witnessed a 51.3% increase in sexual offences, while Ga-Rankuwa had shown a decrease of 29.9%. Olievenhoutbosch had come in with a 186.1% increase in reported cases of attempted murder, and areas such as Dube and Mabopane had reportedly marked decreases, the report said. With Tshwane already being earmarked as the city with the highest incidence of carjackings in the country, the statistics gave a clearer picture of which areas were the most problematic. Compared to the rest of the province, Olievenhoutbosch came in tops with a 144.2% increase of carjackings. It was followed closely by the Sunnyside area  in third place with a 118.2% increase, from 44 incidents reported in 2015/16 to 96 cases for this financial year after Moffatview. Akasia came in 8th place with a 46 case difference reported from 102 cases previously reported during 2015/16. Pretoria News
