Pretoria - Dark clouds filled the CBD sky when a Tshwane Metro Bus burst into flames on Friday. Firefighters managed to extinguish the fire before it spread to other vehicles, but all that was left of the bus was an empty shell. The bus caught alight as it drove along Pretorious street in the CBD at around 11am on Friday morning, leaving passers-by in shock and forcing many to stop and stare as the smoke billowed high. The driver jumped out of the bus shortly before it went up in flames.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The blaze left one car, parked on the side of the road, singed. Owner Matipa Sotheni said he was shocked to receive a phone call alerting him about his car that had 'caught fire'. His car, a VW Jetta, was close to the spot on the road where the bus driver stopped when he realised fire was coming from his engine. Nobody was injured in the incident. Pretoria News
