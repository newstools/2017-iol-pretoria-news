With an estimated population of 19 million, New Delhi is ranked as among the most polluted cities in the world, but plans to tackle the worsening ambient air quality do not appear to have worked so far. Residents of the city woke up to a morning shrouded by thick smog, as doctors warned of a health crisis and advised people not to venture outdoors unless absolutely 
necessary. The levels of suspended particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) hovered between 400 and 900 micrograms per cubic metre from yesterday, several times the safe limit. The WHO recommends that people are not exposed to PM2.5 levels above 10 micrograms averaged over a year, or 25 micrograms in any 24-hour period, as the small particles can get deep into the lungs and even the blood stream. “Delhi has become a gas chamber. Every year this happens during this part of the year,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, reacting to the high pollution. “Considering high levels of pollution, I have asked Education Minister Manish Sisodia to consider closing schools for a few days,” he said on his Twitter account. Extra measures, such as a four-time hike in parking fees and limiting vehicle numbers, may kick in if the situation does not improve, officials said. Weather analysts suggested the smog could be caused by a complete absence of wind, with moisture 
trapping emissions from the ground. - dpa
