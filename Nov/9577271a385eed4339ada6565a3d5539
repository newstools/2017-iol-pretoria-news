The custodians of security and peace assembled at the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) headquarters where they were thanked for their contribution to peace and stability during the year. Members of the SANDF were told to be peaceful first before ensuring there was peace across the continent. “As the SANDF we are peacekeepers all over Africa, and we can only go and keep peace if we have peace in ourselves, so we must keep peace. “Those soldiers who are in the DRC and at borders, we must make sure they operate in peace for they are the peacemakers, let everybody be filled with peace, and if I had the authority, I would indoctrinate you by peace,” Jamangile  told the packed marquee. SANDF chief General Solly Shoke acknowledged the members’ contribution during the ceremony. “Today I stand before you here to say thank you for what you have done during very difficult circumstances, to be able to achieve our constitutional mandate and I think you deserve applause. “For me it is important to say thank you to everybody who made it possible for us to achieve what we have achieved, because normally it is necessary when people do well to thank them for the work well done.” He, too, touched on the significance of exercising peace as SANDF members. “For us as soldiers who are custodians of security and peace in our country, it is important to emphasise inner peace because once we are at inner peace we will look at the world in a positive light. People who have not yet found peace always look at the world negatively and focus on the negatives even if there is light,” he said. He told the soldiers to get enough rest during the holidays and return prepared to work hard next year.
