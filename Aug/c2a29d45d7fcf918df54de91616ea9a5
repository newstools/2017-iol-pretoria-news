Pretoria -  About 10 buses packed with protesters from Mabopane, Winterveld, Klipgat and Ga-Rankuwa have descended on the Old Putco Depot in Marabastad on Monday morning. The 500 plus protesters are gearing up to march to Tshwane House to hand over a memorandum to executive mayor Solly Msimanga. They are singing and chanting while waiting for more protesters to join the march. Tshwane Metro Police and the SAPS are keeping a close eye on the protesters. Spokesperson for the Baagi Concerned Forum David Ratladi Baagi said that the communities of Ga-Rankuwa, Mabopane, Winterveld and Klipgat pay a reduced rate for services to Tshwane and the Soshanguve community pays a higher rate. But now the City of Tshwane intends raising the communities rates to equal that of Shoshanguve. " We as the community of Mabopane, Winterveld and Klipgat were not consulted," he said. Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said affected streets will include Eskia Mphahlele, Struben, Thabo Sehume and Madiba streets. Pretoria News
