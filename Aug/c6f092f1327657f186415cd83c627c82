RAPULA MOATSHE Tshwane transport MMC Sheila Lynn Senkubuge handed over a bus to Broederstroom Primary School in Flora Park. The bus will transport learners from their respective homes to school. Pupils are between the ages of 3 and 6 and come from destitute families. Senkubuge encouraged pupils to take education seriously and study hard. The donation follows a council resolution in May 2017 that the city should donate decommissioned buses to recognised and registered farm schools. The donation is solely meant for schools that have applied and meet the set requirements. Broederstroom Primary School made an application after their 24 year old school bus became economically unviable to be maintained. The old bus also experienced continuous breakdowns which resulted in more than 80 learners arriving late for schooling and/or missing out on lessons.
