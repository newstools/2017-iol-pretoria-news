The demonstrators holding placards which read "Say No to dagga",say they will not rest until the matter is over.

Bophelo Mokaba, one of the demonstrators expressed his anger and explained why it must not be legalised. "Weed destroys you,there is no way it can build you. I used to be a heavy smoker of weed and I never used to care about anything and anyone but weed," he said fuming. Mokaba said they will continue demonstrating for as long as the couple appear in court and will not back down. "We will be back again tomorrow the fight continues," he said.
