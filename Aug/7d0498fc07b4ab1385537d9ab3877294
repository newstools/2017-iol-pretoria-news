Moon told a nationally televised press conference that though it does not need to be in a hurry, dialogue between South Korea and the North should be resumed. Effort and time would be needed to reopen talks that, in the main, halted between the two parts 10 years ago as a result of Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and ballistic missile developments, Moon said. Moon, who took office in May, said the atmosphere for dialogue would be fostered by Pyongyang stopping further provocations. He said he would consider dispatching a special envoy to Pyongyang, if it helped to improve inter-Korean relations and resolve the nuclear issue. Tensions eased on the peninsula after US President Donald Trump said that top North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a “wise and well reasoned” decision not to fire missiles towards the US island of Guam. According to Pynongyang’s KCNA news agency, Kim had decided to delay the missile launch in order to wait and see what the US would do next. The South Korean leader said Trump had agreed to consult fully with and get consent from South Korea in advance of American actions towards the North. He pledged to prevent war from breaking out by all means. - Xinhua
