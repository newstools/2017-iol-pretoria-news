JOHANNESBURG - The South African business people have been urged to
reach out to their Mozambican counterparts and establish partnerships that would enable them to access trade and investment opportunities in the neighbouring
country. The Board Advisor of the
Mozambique Investment and Export Promotion Agency (APIEX), Dr Gil Bires said
partnerships would be a perfect vehicle for exploring opportunities in Mozambique to the benefit of SA and Mozambique. “As a national investment
and export promotion agency we are delighted to see the South African
business people showing interest in our country and coming over to seek
opportunities here. We view the participation of the South African companies in
FACIM as an indication of our neighbour’s commitment to enhancing bilateral
economic trade relations and increasing trade and investment relations between
the two sister countries,” said Bires. He singled out oil and gas
as one of Mozambique’s
natural resources that present a plethora of business opportunities
for local and foreign companies. Also Read: Businesses to be fined if 60% of staff are not from SA “I am encouraging you to
establish partnerships with your Mozambican counterparts for the exploitation
of these and other opportunities that are available in the Mozambican economy.
I want to assure you that the business environment in Mozambique
remains stable despite a number of challenges. There are ongoing efforts at all
levels to address these challenges in order to make the environment more
conducive and attractive for trade and investment,” said Bires. He further explained that
his organisation, which was created by the Mozambican government in October,
last year, was working hard to woo investors to country. FACIM is an international
multi-sectoral trade fair held annually to showcase Mozambique as an attractive
destination for trade and investment. Almost 2 000 companies from more
than 30 countries are participating in the trade fair. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
