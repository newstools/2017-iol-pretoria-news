He was readmitted three weeks ago at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria to undergo mental observation for a month. Zinde has been charged with murder, drug possession, assault, and attempted murder. The 23-year-old is accused of killing his 50-year-old mother in June last year. Hope Zinde is a former SABC board member, journalist and television news anchor. He was subsequently released on R10000 bail in September, but was re-arrested in November for allegedly attacking his father, Dr Lebohang Manoto, at his Walkerville home, south of Joburg. The State charged him with assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm and attempted murder. TheState alleges that he killed his mother at their home in Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort Dam. Her body was found on June 11, 2016, inside the boot of her car. Zinde was referred to undergo psychiatric evaluation at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital following his arrest. The initial assessment report from the hospital declared that he was fit to stand trial and he was capable of understanding court proceedings. The report further stated that he did not suffer from any mental disorder when he allegedly killed his mother. Prosecutor Andre Wilsenach said Zindeâ€™s re-admission was based on the assault and attempted murder charges. In December, the National Prosecuting Authority agreed to centralise the two cases. Zinde will make his next appearance after his mental observation report has been finalised. - ANA
