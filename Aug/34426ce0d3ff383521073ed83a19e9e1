Organisers put the number of protesters at more than 2million and said it was the largest rally ever staged in the city of 20million. Indian media estimated the number of people at the rally between 600000 and about 1million. Rising unemployment and falling farm incomes are driving farming communities across India, from the state of Haryana in the north to Gujarat in the west, to redouble their calls for reservations in jobs and education. “Farming is no longer profitable and jobs are not available,” said one protester, Pradip Munde, a farmer from Osmanabad, a town more than 400km south-east of Mumbai. “Reservation can ensure us better education and jobs.” Protesters dismissed as insufficient a proposal by the chief minister of Maharashtra state, Devendra Fadnavis, to consider granting reservations to the Maratha community, which is mainly dependent on farming. “We are not satisfied with the government’s promises. The chief minister hasn’t given any concrete assurances to solve farmers’ problems,” said Bhaiya Patil, one of the rally organisers. The protest rally seriously disrupted road and rail traffic in 
Mumbai. “Many people couldn’t enter the (park) venue as it was packed. We had made arrangements for twomillion people, but we ran out of supplies,” said Patil. The city’s famed "dabbawalas", who deliver packed lunches to people working in offices across Mumbai, suspended operations for the day, as did schools in the affected area. Wednesday’s rally was the concluding protest of a series of 57 marches staged over the past year in Maharashtra by the Maratha community to press its demands. - Reuters
