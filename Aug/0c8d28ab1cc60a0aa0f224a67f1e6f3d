The opposition said the ANC had failed to uphold the constitution by targeting its senior MPs for voting against President Jacob Zuma. But Ramaphosa said the party was dealing with the matter internally after it hauled Makhosi Khoza and Derek Hanekom before disciplinary hearings. However, Hanekom has a few days to respond to ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe’s letter to say why he should not be removed as chairperson of the National Disciplinary Committee. Ramaphosa was appearing in Parliament to answer questions on the Guptas, state-owned entities (SOEs) and the economy. On the SOEs, he said the government was trying to improve their efficiency to stop getting bailouts - they have received almost R500billion in bailouts in the past few years. He said they wanted to improve their balance sheet and merge those that were not doing well. Ramaphosa said no one would be spared in the prosecution of those involved in state capture. Without referring to the Gupta family by name, he said they would not be spared either: “Nobody, no family is above the law. Even in this case, whoever is found to have committed misdemeanour should be dealt with.” This was after opposition parties complained about the announcement by the Gupta family that they were selling their assets. Ramaphosa also told MPs he did not have powers to appoint a commission of inquiry to probe state capture: “As a leader of government, I have no power to investigate.” He said the law enforcement agencies must investigate state capture "and leave no stone unturned". Opposition parties have warned that the National Prosecuting Authority and the Hawks were dragging their feet to investigate the Guptas, despite a trove of leaked e-mails.
