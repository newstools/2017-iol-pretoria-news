Rudzani Matshili Social media has been abuzz since Thursday night and Bonang Matheba's book is the reason behind it. The radio and TV personality recently released her much anticipated book titled From A to B and it topped the best selling book list and people congratulated her on this achievement. But on Thursday photos of some of the pages from her book started circulating on social media, highlighted with a red pen pointing out grammatical and factual errors. One of the errors that caught the eye was about her date of birth. It reads "On 24 June 1987 a day my mother describes as the coldest Thursday of that year, Andrew and Charlotte Matheba welcomed a baby girl into the world," but the 24th was on a Wednesday and not Thursday. Others were left wondering if whether she knew when exactly she was born. Those who have read the book took to Twitter to express their disappointments with some even saying it should be given out for free and not sold. Here are some of the twitter reactions to the book: Boo Bear @Chuma_Luck... 
So basically Bonang was born Wednesday & Thursday 24th of June 1987? Vuyiswa Manzi @cutestvee
