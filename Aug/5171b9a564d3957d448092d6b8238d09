Pretoria - Ipid boss Robert McBride briefly appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday in connection with the alleged assault of his teenage daughter, where he was granted R10 000 bail. The State did not oppose bail on condition that he did not make contact with the witnesses in the case. The charge against him is child abuse, alternatively assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. The trial was postponed to October 2 for further investigations. McBride did not comment on the allegations, but Ipid said in a statement that he wanted the trial to start as soon as possible so that he could clear his name. McBride denied that he assaulted his daughter on August 19 and earlier told the media that he was merely admonishing her. But the teenager told the media that the alleged assault was not an isolated incident. She claimed it “happened all the time.” zelda.venter@inl.co.za
