The 86-second-long video clip showed the three tests of a ballistic missile with an improved warhead power and a range of 500km and two ballistic missiles with a range of 800km, according to South Korea’s defence ministry. The tests were carried out on August 24 as a final flight test, before deploying the home-grown ballistic missiles. Their development was led by the Seoul-run Agency for Defence Development (ADD). The rare release of the missile test footage by South Korea followed the North’s launch of an unidentified missile that flew over the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido. The North Korean missile, which was fired from an area near the capital Pyongyang, passed over the Japanese territory and landed in the Pacific Ocean after a flight of about 2500 km. It was lofted as high as 550km. Meanwhile, China yesterday asked the US and South Korea to respect the security interests and concerns of China and other regional countries, and to stop their deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence missile defence system. - Xinhua
