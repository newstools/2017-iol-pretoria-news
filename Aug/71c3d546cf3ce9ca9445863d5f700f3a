Pretoria - As far as poverty is concerned, children are the most affected by it and this becomes a problem for the country as children being poor mean they can't go to school or they will not do well in school. This is according to Statistician General Dr Pali Lehohla during the media briefing on the country's examination of absolute poverty trends between the years 2006 and 2015. "Children are poor because they live in poor households and this is worrying because what will happen in the future if children are poor?" he asked. He said 79,2% of individuals with no formal education were poor compared to only 8,4% of individuals who had a post-matric qualification in 2015. "Without education you will be and remain poor but the majority of South Africans are not educated which means the scourge of poverty is far from being over," Lehohla said. Pretoria News
