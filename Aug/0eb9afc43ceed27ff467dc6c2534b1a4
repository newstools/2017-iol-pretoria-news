The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Monday
that there have been two dozen reported incidents, including 19 in the United States. "One consumer reported permanent scarring from a
chemical burn and another consumer reported chemical burns and swelling to her
leg, face, neck, chest, upper body and hands," according to a statement. The cases, which were sold for the iPhone 6, 6s and 7 from
October 2015 through June 2017, resemble a snow globe - with glitter that
floats inside the liquid. Read also:Â Apple gets more iPhone fans MixBin Electronics, which sold the cases, said in a
statement that there was a risk that the cases could crack or break and the
liquid could leak out and irritate users' skin. The cases ranged in price from $15 to $65 from Amazon, Henri
Bendel, MixBin, Nordstrom Rack, Tory Burch and Victoria's Secret. The cases
were manufactured in China,
according to the commission's report. The commission said users with the recalled cases should
stop using them and contact MixBin Electronics for a refund. The full product
descriptions are available on the commission's website. MixBin Electronics did
not immediately respond to a request for comment on the recall. BLOOMBERG
