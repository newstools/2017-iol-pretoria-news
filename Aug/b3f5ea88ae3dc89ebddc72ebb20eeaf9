GOITSEMANG TLHABYEÂ 
goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za THE trial of the plant has finally commenced as the second application stalling proceedings in the "dagga couple" trial has been dismissed by Gauteng High Court, Pretoria Judge Natvarlal Ranchod. The application requesting that all expert annexes be struck out due to their irrelevance to the trial was brought by State representative SC Leah Gcabushe and Doctors for Life advocate, Redge Willis. The trial into the legalisation of cannabis was delayed as legal representatives brought two applications. The first application sought to have the courts overturn the ruling granting "dagga couple", Julian Stobbs and Myrtle Clarke's NPO, Field of Green for all (Fogfa) permission to live stream proceedings. The second application sought to have what the state termed, irrelevant expert annexes, summaries and articles struck out. Ranchod following submissions by both parties dismissed the application and said that costs would be reserved for the end of the trial on who is to pay for applications. The Judge notified the court that the reasons for the dismissal would be given at the end of the trial. In introducing the cause of the application sought advocate Don Mahon explained to the court that current legislation violated a number of constitutional rights and current prohibition was unjustifiable.
