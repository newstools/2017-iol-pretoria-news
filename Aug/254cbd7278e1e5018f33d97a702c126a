It is a structure made of female councillors from all political parties and is aimed at addressing the constant struggle for gender equality and the challenge of under-representation of women in legislative bodies. Speaker Katlego Mathebe said the structure was not to oppose each other’s political parties, but to work together and exchange ideas as women. “We are from different political parties but in this structure we are one as women and we should empower each other. “We are not here to oppose each other’s political parties, we are here to reflect together and form a support group for all women in council as we are products of victims of a patriarchal society and that’s what must bring us together,” she said. “There is no doubt that women can have it all however, in the pursuit of this we forget that achieving all does not mean achieving more than the next woman. "I believe the success of one woman assists the success of another.” Councillor Rose Maake of the DA was elected chairperson. “I am honoured to be seen fit and adequate to lead such powerful women and I hope we will work together to achieve our goal. "This is where we will make our voices heard, attend to issues affecting women and to generally support each other,” she said. Maake told the Pretoria News it would mean a lot if women were represented in structures were men mostly dominated. Gender Equality Commissioner Lulama Nare told the female councillors gathered that the journey they took was not an easy one, and for them to achieve their goals they would have to believe they were equal. “The constitution says we are all equal but culture and religion has created layers to this equality. “For you to achieve your goals it is you who must believe that you are indeed equal as the constitution states,” Nare said. She advised councillors to get gender equality training as women were not born gender sensitive.
