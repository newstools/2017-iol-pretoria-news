SAKHILE NDLAZI Civil rights organisation AfriForum is laying criminal charges of incitement to trespass against Julius Malema at the Lyttelton Police Station. This follows after Malema encouraged his supporters to grab the land of white people during the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) birthday celebrations this past week. According to reports, Malema took the following standpoint during his speech:
 
“If you don’t have a piece of land you are a coward. Go and identify a piece of land anywhere you like. That is your land. In my ward in Seshego we did that. The owner came and said he had been listening and we could take half. If you don’t listen you will lose the whole land. White land owners must share land.” Deputy CEO of Afriforum Ernst Roets said he expected the National Prosecuting Authority and the police to investigate the matter without delay and to formally charge Malema as soon as possible. "I expect feedback on the progress on a regular basis, " he said.
