They boycotted classes on Friday, threatening to wear their preferred cut of pants until school authorities agreed with them. The chairperson of the school governing body, Brian Zyster, told the Pretoria News the school was not averse to change. The Department of Education, however, said it was a ridiculous demand and disrupted classes as students tried to concentrate on preliminary exams. South Africans took to social media platforms to condemn the pupils’ behaviour, most saying that pupils should be focusing on their exams and studies, not looks. Don Vuyo wrote: “This is so sad; these kids are too concerned about looking cool rather than being top achievers in academics and school sports, etc.” Twitter user Jou Ma Se Kind said: “So the hair issue is over; now it’s #SkinnyPants. What’s next? Let's demand better grades first.” Arnold Rivalani wrote on Twitter: “Kids are prioritising skinny jeans than their education. I cry for my beloved country." Zaahid Vally wrote on Facebook: “This is nonsense. In our school days we followed school requirements as it was the rule. There was order; we should not allow this to happen, where kids think they can decide everything without consequences.” Some blamed parents for failing to guide their children, with Sharon van Greunen asking where they were when the children boycotted class. She wrote: “Do children go to school to learn or fashion parade? Where are the parents?” On Twitter, Lux Luxster called on parents to discipline their children. Classes resumed on Monday and pupils will have to continue to wearing their common grey uniform cut until the final verdict is issued within seven days. The governing body said parents would vote on the matter later this week.
