Baxter will not travel to Zambia for the return leg on Saturday, but revealed in a statement yesterday that Fortune will accompany his assistant, Thabo Senong. “I have had very little time to concentrate on the absolutely vital assignment that is the Cape Verde (World Cup) qualifier. I am going to use some of the time to watch the PSL games over the weekend and prepare for the squad announcement on Monday,” Baxter explained. “One of the staff that will be travelling to Zambia, albeit on a temporary basis, is Fortune. He arrived (yesterday morning) and will follow the training session at FNB Stadium. We are still to decide if he will go with Thabo to be some kind of an assistant or a spectator - just to see how we do things. When the squad gets back, there will be a conversation between him and the association to see if we found common ground, and also to see if there is any room to bring him on a permanent basis. What is happening now is just a matter of the two parties having a look at the situation.” Baxter was appointed Bafana coach in May, replacing axed Shakes Mashaba, but has been without a permanent technical team since deciding not to retain the services of Owen da Gama and goalkeeper coach Lucky Shiburi, who were part of Mashaba’s backroom staff.  The only exception was Senong. Bafana face Cape Verde on September 1 away and host them four days later at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Baxter was expected to announce his travelling squad yesterday but the press conference was postponed to Monday.
