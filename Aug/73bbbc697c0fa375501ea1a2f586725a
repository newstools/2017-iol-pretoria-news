Supporters are expected to march to the Union Buildings, where they will continue with their anti-Zuma demonstrations. Dressed in their traditional red regalia, supporters expressed their displeasure at Zuma as the sitting president, stating vociferously that they want him to be removed from power. One of them Leslie Dube from Sunnyside said he had joined the march because Zuma has cost the country so much.
