Pretoria - Solidarity's legal team will seek for the equality court to force the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to appoint magistrate Martin Kroukamp as the senior magistrate of the Alberton magistrate court. Legal representative Gretta Engelbrecht told the court sitting in the Palace of Justice in Pretoria, they intended on making the submission for the court's intervention. This despite being aware that the minister of justice was the only representative tasked in making appointments of magistrates. Engelbrecht said this appeal was because they believed Kroukamp had been unfairly discriminated against by former minister Jeff Radebe after he was earmarked by the Magistrate's Commission as the only suitable candidate in 2010. Engelbrecht said: "despite him having been chosen, the minister simply dismissed his candidacy due to him being a white male. The only reasons given were Â that the pool to draw from was not large enough and not in line with transformation of the judiciary." Current Minister of Justice Michael Masutha informed the equality court in September 2014 that he would also review his predecessor's decision to withdraw and re-advertise 22 other senior magistrate posts.
