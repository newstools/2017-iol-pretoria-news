Is it funny when the first citizen of the country makes an enormous mistake by firing a capable minister of finance with immediate negative effects on the economy? It didn’t seem funny at the time. There’s a little joke about a man who staggered backwards in a full bus and landed on a woman’s lap. He said: “Sorry, ma’am, but I’m a Laplander.” The quirk caused at least a titter. Then the man related the incident to his wife and said the man had said: “Sorry, ma’am, but I’m an Eskimo”. The wife remarked that she saw nothing funny about the story. The husband was perplexed and said: “Well, it seemed very funny at the time.” Dismissing the minister of finance without apparent reason did seem a bit funny at the time. But a few months later, another respected minister of finance was dismissed by the same president, with catastrophic consequences. I’m afraid that hard as one tries, there’s is no mirth in making the same reckless mistake. The ANC wants MPs to vote in a way that will keep President Jacob Zuma in power in the face of repeated calls for his dismissal. The rationale is to keep the ANC intact, but there is a motion on the table not to destroy the ANC but only to remove a reckless man - a secret ballot under circumstances where a show of hands might keep the president in power simply because everybody knows that he will retaliate. National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete will probably be less at risk of being dismissed if the president goes. We now know that she was brave; the consequences are perhaps not going to be funny; meanness, pettiness and revenge are seldom funny. Ben Smit Cape Town
