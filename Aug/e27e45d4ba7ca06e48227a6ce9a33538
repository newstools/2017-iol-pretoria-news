Vadi and the Gautrain Management Agency said Tuesday's announcement by M&R was “premature”. “The Gautrain Management Agency further notes that the Gauteng provincial government has not received a formal notice of any change in shareholding in Bombela Concession Company. “The province has thus not had an opportunity to review the transaction as it is entitled to under the concession agreement. Its approval of the change in shareholding may be required. “Any such media reports based on the Murray & Roberts announcement is thus premature,” Vadi and Gautrain Management Agency said in a joint statement. “This serves to confirm that ownership of the entire Gautrain system is vested in the Gautrain Management Agency, a Gauteng provincial public entity.” Announcing the new ownership plans, Murray & Roberts said it had raised its 33% stake in Gautrain operator Bombela Concession Company to 50%. This is after Bombela Concession Company shareholders Bouygues and Bombardier both agreed to each sell their 8.5% stake to Murray & Roberts. The construction company said it expected the deal, valued at R405million, to be finalised before the end of the year. - ANA
