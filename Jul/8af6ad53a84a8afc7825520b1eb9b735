RAPULA MOATSHE Stick-wielding security guards ran amok in the inner-city, marching to the EFF offices in Pretorius Street. Some intimidated their fellow security officers who were on duty at other city departments in the city. They were earlier demonstrating outside Tshwane House on the corner of Madiba and Lilian Ngoyi streets. At Tshwane House, they demanded to be addressed by mayor Solly Msimanga and refused to leave the city headquarters until he had come to speak to them. Msimanga was said to be unavailable and the MMC for community safety Derrick Kissoonduth came out with the intention of addressing them, but soon went back inside the building. Kissoonduth claimed he was not aware of issues that brought them to the municipality. Outside the EFF offices, they continued to sing Struggle songs and demanded to know why the party leaders failed to influence the municipality not to terminate contracts of private security companies under which they worked.&nbsp; They complained that leaders let them down by allowing the &quot;white DA&quot; to decide their fate. The jobs of more than 3000 security guards were affected by the termination of contracts. EFF leader Obakeng Ramabodu refuted that the party was a sellout, saying the guards should not be used by opportunists wanting to hijack their genuine concerns. Ramabodu said he had arranged a meeting with Msimanga on Thursday to talk about the workers' grievances.
