Pre-registration until yesterday allows players to invite their friends to battle out the referral leaderboard for a chance to win an iPhone and 1 Apple share. Throughout the game, players can win their share of more than $15000 (R197000) in prizes, including a trip for two to the USA. When EasyEquities asked their fast growing and engaged local community of more than 50000 investors, which names they wanted to see on the new US platform, they went crazy on Twitter talking about their favourite stock picks. The top 10 brand mentions were: Tesla; Apple; Alphabet; Berkshire Hathaway; Facebook; Amazon; Microsoft; Nvidia; Coke and Johnson & Johnson. Anyone can sign up to #playintheusa by visiting playintheusa.easyequities.co.za and referring friends. Follow EasyEquities on Twitter and Facebook if you want in on some larger than life daily & weekly giveaways. Players will use the $10000 in their EasyEquities US$ demo account to invest in US stocks, using the EasyEquities blog, research and community to help with their investment picks. Full game rules, prizes and qualifying criteria can be found on playintheusa.easyequities.co.za.
