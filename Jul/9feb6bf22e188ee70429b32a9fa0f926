Johannesburg – The Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries on Wednesday confirmed isolation of the virus on two other farms. This
follows the confirmation of an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza of
the H5N8 type on two farms in Mpumalanga. “The
farms involved are commercial layer chicken farms in Gauteng
and Mpumalanga.  Both farms have been quarantined and further
control measures are being implemented to curb the spread of the disease. DAFF
has also confirmed that the depopulation of the two sites affected in June has
been completed”. “This
strain has been found not to be dangerous to humans and the birds affected are
a very small percentage of the total South African chicken flock. At this stage
there is still a limited impact on chicken and egg supply,” said the department. The
department said South African Poultry Association and the Poultry Disease
Management Agency (PDMA) continue to support the efforts of South African
Veterinary Service Authorities in implementing control measures for the
disease. Read also: 260 000 chickens culled due to #BirdFlu “The
registration process in respect of sellers and traders of live chickens is
progressing well and role players are encouraged to comply with this control measure.
Farmers are encouraged to observe strict biosecurity principles during this
time to prevent introduction of the disease onto their farms. Should farmers
require assistance they should contact their veterinarian or a state
veterinarian,” said the department. Members
of the public were requested to report any sightings of higher than usual
levels of chicken or wild bird mortalities to their local Department of Agriculture
or alternatively to the PDMA. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
