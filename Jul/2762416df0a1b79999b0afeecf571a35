GOITSEMANG TLHABYE goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za  CIVIL rights organisation AfriForum and trade union Solidarity are to approach international sporting bodies to stop political interference in numerous sporting codes. The organisations representatives said they will in the coming month submit their report to various bodies including World Rugby, The International Cricket Council, the International Netball Federation and the International Association of Athletics Federations. In the report titled Transformation in SA Sport: Scoreboard not in Government favour which is to be submitted to five international bodies contains information that allegedly show in detail how the relevant South African sporting bodies acted contrary to the international rules and regulations of the applicable sport disciplines they are members of. “Political interference in sport is in direct conflict with the rules and regulations of the international sporting bodies who will be visited. Under the previous regime, the ANC argued that merits alone should be the criterion, and now they don’t follow their own opinion,” said AfriForum spokesperson Henk Maree. Solidarity spokerson Anton van der Bijl added that governments racial ideology had been evident for a long time and that racially motivated intentions could no longer be hidden. “The court should condemn government’s denial of opportunities to excellent sports people as a result of its illegal racial quotas,” he said.
