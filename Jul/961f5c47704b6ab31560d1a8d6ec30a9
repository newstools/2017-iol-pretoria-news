The legislators visited the centre in the east of Pretoria yesterday, with a view to mend failures of society by being good role models to young men without father figures. The Legislature's deputy Speaker, Uhuru Moiloa, said it was important to talk to youth and become mentors. “We come to you as your fathers, uncles, brothers and as a community to plead guilty before you because you missed something in your life that led you to this place,” he said. “The life of solitude certainly could not be where you wanted to be.” He encouraged them to take their visit as an opportunity to open up to their “spiritual fathers” so they could gain mentors or even friends, he said. “Let's get to the bottom of your hearts through our interactions so that when you leave this place to rejoin society you are better people.” Moiloa commended offenders who matriculated with distinctions and pledged to offer them study material or stationery. The young inmates were encouraged to exploit opportunities to study further while serving their sentence. The centre was opened by former president Nelson Mandela in August 1998 to accommodate young offenders between the ages of 14 and 21. It caters for 149 offenders, of which 61 were reportedly serving sentences of less than 24 months.
