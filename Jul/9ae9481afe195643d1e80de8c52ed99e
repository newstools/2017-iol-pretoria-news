Access roads to the Square are now closed to regular traffic and parking bays have been removed as the city moves to change it from a traffic roundabout to a place of relaxation. MMC for Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture Ntsiki Mokhotho said the upgrade of the Square was separate from the planned open-air entertainment hub called Lalela (Listen) Freedom of Expression Monument. Lalela was announced by mayor Solly Msimanga during his State of the Capital Address in April. The idea is to create a monument to freedom of expression, because human rights couldn’t be taken for granted, Msimanga said at the time. Mokhoto said there had been ongoing meetings to discuss the Lalela proposal while Msimanaga told the Pretoria News the city was in talks with the departments of tourism and arts and culture with respect to Lalela. Among the plans is to honour Nelson Mandela’s legacy at the Square with the addition of a rock excavated from the Robben Island limestone quarry where Mandela and other political prisoners famously worked during their incarceration. Msimanga said he hoped to have the plan for the facility ready next month so work could begin. The Lalela project was mooted under the previous ANC administration, but did not come to fruition. The estimated cost of the project, as calculated by the ANC municipality was at least R12million, but there was no figure as yet mentioned by the new administration. The landscaping at the Square is set to give the city centre an improved look with more trees, better lawns, and new street furniture. Upon completion, a section of Paul Kruger Street around the inner perimeter of the Square would no longer be accessible to motorists. It was, however, open to the A Re Yeng bus station. The Paul Kruger statue, a prominent feature on the Square, is set to stay as are the tramlines found under the tar and dating back to the time Kruger was president of the Transvaal Republic, which were uncovered during work on the A Re Yeng.
