Pretoria - About 100 Congress of South African Studentsâ€™ (Cosas) members gathered at Burgers Park to make their way to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). They were also given light meals so they would not loot any stalls in the CBD trying to get something to eat. "We organised food today because previously there was looting because students were hungry and had travelled a long distance, " said COSAS secretary general Khulekani Skosana. He said they wanted to prove to society that they were not hooligans and students who cared about their future.

"Society thinks we are a bunch of criminals and hooligans, but we are actually fighting for our future, we don't want to end up like our parents who are maids and garden boys. We want to tell Governor Lesetja Kganyago that the value of people is more important than the value of the Rand,"Skosana said.
