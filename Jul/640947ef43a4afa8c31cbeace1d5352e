Visconti™4 is a leading-edge, multi engine road safety solution
that provides drivers with real-time analytics of road conditions and potential
dangers. Electronic systems are taking on an increasingly central
role in driving and this includes advanced assistance systems and support for
autonomous vehicles, and particularly in promoting road safety. The latest iteration of the influential European New Car
Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), the EU-backed safety standards, adds criteria
for evaluating anti-collision features that has improved protection for
bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, Toshiba and Storage Corporatio said: “The
Visconti™4 image recognition processor is equipped with eight media processing
engines, allowing it to execute eight applications simultaneously. It can
detect and analyze camera-generated images and recognizes traffic lanes; nearby
vehicles, both parked and moving; traffic signs and signals; the headlights of
oncoming vehicles; plus the most vulnerable road users of all, bicyclists and
pedestrians.” Read also:  Foxconn to build a $10billion tech factory in US Visconti™4 has double the number of processing engines of
its predecessor, the Visconti™2, used by DENSO since 2015. It also integrates a
new image recognition algorithm, Enhanced CoHOG Accelerator that delivers enhanced
processing of luminance differences between objects and their backgrounds to
better detect pedestrians at night and low light conditions. “The global market of vehicle-mounted cameras is expected to
approach $9.6 billion in 20212. Toshiba is committed respond to with automotive
semiconductor solutions that further pursue traffic safety,” the document
stated. Toshiba and DENSO are also cooperating in AI, on the
development of deep neural network-intellectual property (DNN-IP) for use in
image recognition, and they also plan to bring this state-of-the-art technology
of future additions to the Visconti series. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
