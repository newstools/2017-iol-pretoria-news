Matlhatsi Dibakwane THE designer of the new SA Post Office stamp intended for international use chose bees to raise awareness of their great importance to the country and the world. Jessica Leah Delaney, a student at the Open Window Institute for Arts and Digital Sciences in Centurion, told the Pretoria News that the stamp, called Bees for Africa, would basically spread the message about bees to the world. It was part of a competition in which my college worked with the Post Office to create artworks for stamp series. I entered my designs and they were chosen. From there the designs were altered and modified into the beautiful stamps that they are now. Delaney said the artwork of the stamps were all created digitally and described the opportunity as humbling. My family is just as excited as I am and very proud of the work I have done, said the 23 year old.Post Office spokesperson Johan Kruger said bees were chosen because of their importance in food production and the fact that they were under threat. We saw it as an opportunity to create awareness around bees, he said. Bees are absolutely important for food production and the reproduction of plants, but they are under threat because people use many pesticides and destroy their habitat. We wanted to create awareness of the fact that bees have a place in the world. South Africa is home to the African and Cape bees; that is why we put emphasis on bees and embrace them. Kruger said the African bee stamps were planned for international letters and a limited run of 2000 sheets had since been printed. Every week, we send 200000 items to other countries, many of them with stamps on them. He said he believed that many of the bee stamps would be bought by collectors.Kruger expected them to be sold out within four months.
