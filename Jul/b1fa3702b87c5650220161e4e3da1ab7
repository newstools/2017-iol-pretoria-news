“You know, to run my ministry I need a million rands a month to keep this thing going”. You would be mistaken if you thought that this was a ministry in government. There’s just one problem - it’s not. This was a statement that emerged in the final Report  of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL)  on commercialisation of churches. “Religion is a big business and religious leaders should also pay tax,” said the CRL in a statement following its recent investigation to reports of irregular practises by some church leaders. Some of the recommendations made by the commission included ; - Religious leaders and institutions must be registered and pay tax like any other business in South Africa. - Foreign nationals wishing to open churches in South Africa should undergo a strict vetting process. However, religious leader Pastor Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng had announced that he intends to take legal action against the CRL and also slammed the commission saying  that it continually attacked and painted him in a bad light. The religious leader threatened to shut down his church if his followers don’t help him with legal bills to sue the CRL Rights Commission. He also said that religious leaders cannot be regulated by people who don’t understand their mandate from God. He has since threatened to stop helping those in need if his supporters don’t assist him with the lawsuit. “I’ve given my people nine weeks starting from 16 July. I’ll be focusing on people who’ll help me, who care about me and will assist me with this legal battle as I give them service, who need my service. They must register and walk with me.” BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
