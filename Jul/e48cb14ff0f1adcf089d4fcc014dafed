Nhlapo, who was in action for Bafana Bafana in the Chan qualifier against Botswana, comes in as a replacement for Michael Boxall who was released earlier this month. He joins on a three-year deal. With over 70 league appearances for the Clever Boys over the last four seasons, and a short loan spell at Highlands Park, Nhlapo brings added experience to Matsatsantsa a Pitori. Club CEO Stan Matthews said: “Siya is a player we have been watching for a few seasons now. He has represented Bafana Bafana, having been called up by each of the last three national team coaches (Gordon Igesund, Shakes Mashaba and Stuart Baxter). “We have watched how well he did at Bidvest Wits, playing a major role in their third and second placed finishes in the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons. With Grant Kekana doing so well in our last few games last season, we look forward to the contest for the right back spot.” Matthews also confirmed the signing of young Zimbabwe international striker Prince Dube from Zimbabwe’s Highlanders on a four-year deal. The dynamic Dube has netted eight goals in 12 games for Highlanders this season, a scoring spree which has seen him being called up to the Zimbabwe national team where he was again on the scoresheet over the weekend against Namibia. Matthews was deliberate in stressing that United do not want to put too much pressure on the young marksman saying: “Prince is a longer term player for us. He has good technique, pace and skill and can play both centrally and wide. “He may not be displacing (Jeremy) Brockie or (Bradley) Grobler this season but he has the makings of a top attacking player and we look forward to seeing how Eric progresses with him moving forward.” - ANA
