Crews were on site assisting fire department operations and assessing damage at the scene. “Some 140000 residential and commercial customers were left without power which was cut off at the station to allow crews to work on putting the fire out,” the department said. There was no word on when it would be restored, which would occur once the fire was out and the system stabilised in the affected areas, said LADWP, which provides power to 1.6 million customers in the city of Los Angeles.Picture: AP
