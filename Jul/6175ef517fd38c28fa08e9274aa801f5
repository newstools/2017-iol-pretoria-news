goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za THE "CANABRITIES" or 'dagga couple' remain unfazed by criticism as they await to commence their trial for the legalisation of dagga. Julian Stobbs and partner Myrtle Clarke appeared briefly in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria as they were due to start their 19-day trial challenging the legality of cannabis use. Despite the barrage of protesters outside court condemning the challengers to hell and handing out placards on the dangers of dagga use, the couple remained unfazed. The matter however stalled as a request was made for reasons for the granting of the live streaming of proceedings to be furnished in writing was made by the state. Clarke said she and her partner had over the seven years endured being told they were mere drug addicts looking to get off their charges or even called canabrities. She said: "We didn't go into this wanting to be famous, but we understand that it comes with being in the media. We think its only fair in a democratic society that people be allowed to voice their opinions freely." The reasons were provided and the matter is set to start tomorrow at 10:30am in the Gauteng High court, Pretoria.
