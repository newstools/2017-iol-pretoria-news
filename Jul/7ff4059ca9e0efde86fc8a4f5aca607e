GOITSEMANG TLHABYE[email&#160;protected]&nbsp;AGRICULTURAL industry association AgriSA has come out with a resounding no against shale fracking development in the country.&nbsp;Their stance follows an announcement in March by Mineral Resource Minister Mosebenzi Zwane that shale gas development in the Karoo, Western Cape had been given the green light.&nbsp;The Mineral Resource Minister revealed the decision during a community engagement on shale gas development in Richmond, in the Northern Cape.&nbsp;AgriSA president Johannes Moller, speaking at the National Press Club briefing in Centurion this morning said given the remaining uncertainties with respect to water supply and contamination issues surrounding shale gas the association could not support the government s continued pursuit of the venture.&nbsp; As it stands with South Africa s precarious water position and the threat to food security any endeavor by the country to venture into the development must be approached with the utmost caution, he said.&nbsp;Moller said it is in the absence of research looking into these effects that they were of the position that the country was not ready yet.&nbsp;Janse Rabie, Head of Natural Resource at AgriSA, said there were also huge concerns around the granting of technical co-operation permits and exploration rights for shale gas.&nbsp;As it stood in terms of the country s Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act the holders of such rights would then be entitled to exclusive rights to apply for and be granted production rights, Rabie said.
