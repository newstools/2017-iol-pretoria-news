Cape Town – Vodacom’s multi-billion rand acquisition of Safaricom, Kenya’s integrated communications company  on Tuesday received a shot in the arm after a minority shareholder gave the transaction the green light.   Earlier this year, the telecoms giants announced that it had agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in Safaricom in a deal worth R35 billion.  Shameel Joosub, the group chief executive at Vodacom, says the deal will further enhance its position as a leading African mobile communications company and acquiring Safaricom provides Vodacom with a unique opportunity to diversify its financial profile in a single transaction.  “The vote of confidence from Vodacom’s minority shareholders is an important milestone in our journey to become a leading digital company and empowering a connected society. This is an exciting deal that provides Vodacom shareholders with access to a high growth, high margin and high cash generating business in the attractive Kenyan market,” Joosub says.  The biggest draw card for Vodacom was Safaricom’s M-Pesa rollout in Kenya and East Africa.  Joosub says the conclusion of the deal will see Vodacom having a significant presence on the continent. “The proposed transaction increases our presence in East Africa and makes Vodacom a formidable player in financial services on the continent.”  Read also: Vodacom mulls R15bn empowerment stake  Safaricom is owned by the government of Kenya which holds a 35 percent stake, while Vodafone Kenya holds 39.9 percent equity in the company and public investors have 25 percent shareholding in Safaricom.
