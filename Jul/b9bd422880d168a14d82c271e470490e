Pretoria -Â "Metro officers are not security guards." This was written on the placards of Tshwane Metro police officers who gathered at the Old Putco bus station in the centre of Pretoria this morning. The Metro officers and other municipal workers decried the unilateral changes to employment conditions by the City of Tshwane implemented without proper procedure being conducted. Mpho Tladinyane, Regional Secretary for SAMWU, said the decline of services in and around the city was primarily as a result of the low moral workers felt due to the restructuring process underway where they were not consulted first. "When an employer seeks to restructure there are processes that need to be followed. The City can't just introduce a new grading system without informing those that are to be affected by this change," he said.
