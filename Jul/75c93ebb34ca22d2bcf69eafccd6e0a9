Goitsemang Tlhabye ROAD safety was a not a transport issue, but a societal matter that could be overcome in the same manner the scourge of HIV and Aids was being dealt with, Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said. He was addressing the second annual Youth Road Safety Summit in Centurion, attended by hundreds of young people from across the country. We agreed as a nation that HIV/Aids was not the responsibility of the Department of Health and we have come a long way in reducing the scourge. This is because all of us became responsible and so all of us can achieve a lot if we bring young people into the picture. And this is what we re doing here; fighting this problem of road carnage, which is very high and costing the country a lot of money, he said.Maswanganyi applauded the youth who he said since the first summit had been involved in road safety initiatives.He called on the youth to look into being at the forefront of the development of the transport sector, which still had numerous opportunities for them instead of just employment opportunities.This, he said, was due to the fact that the sector was still in dire need for transformation and the inclusivity of black people, youth, women and people with disabilities in particular. There are very few black young people involved in businesses and the economy of the country. It is in this country where the indigenous people do not own the wealth and it is owned by people who come from somewhere else and disempower the original inhabitants of that country, he said. Black people should not only be employees but own enterprise development and be employers. This is what government means when it talks about radical socio-economic transformation to achieve just that goal. Maswanganyi said that to ensure that young people were roped into the transport sector, they had a number of programmes in road construction, rail programmes, maritime and aviation.
