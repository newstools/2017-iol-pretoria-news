Cape Town - The Western Cape High Court handed down judgment in favour of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) in the matter involving Viking Inshore Fishing.  The ongoing challenge to the decision made by the DAFF, in particular the Deputy Director General: Fisheries to include previously disadvantaged new entrants during its 2015/2016 Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP) has been brought to an end as the application to interdict such decision was dismissed with costs.  In a statement, Deputy Director General, Siphokazi Ndudane said the interdict, previously preventing existing and new entrants from participating in the sector has now been lifted.
