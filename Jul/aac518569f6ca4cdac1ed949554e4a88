Rapula Moatshe THE R2 billion city headquarters, Tshwane House, is still not ready to host council meetings. This is owing to a lack of conference equipment such as microphones and wi-fi facilities.Council Speaker Katlego Mathebe said councillors would continue to use the Sammy Marks Council Chamber until further notice.Mathebe said the delay of councillors to move to their new venue was the result of a dispute by a service provider that the installation of conference equipment did not form part of the contract. She said the city administration was in the process of drafting specifications regarding the type of equipment needed at the chamber.The situation prevails despite the new building being already occupied by officials from various departments. The deadline for workers to move into the new building was June 12.Last month, officials from the Speaker s office objected to the instruction to move to the building on the corner of Madiba and Lillian Ngoyi streets, saying it did not comply with health standards.Workers complained that the decision to move them to Tshwane House was unfair because they were not consulted. However, after a meeting between city management and the union, the action did not go ahead. But by last Thursday, the majority of workers from the Speaker s office had moved, with at least 20 of them still refusing to vacate their old workplace.
