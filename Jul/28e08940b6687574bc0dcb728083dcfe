Cape Town
- Government has taken an initiative to amend the National Land Transport Act
in an effort to accommodate e-hailing services following the industry’s
increased violence. Transport Minister, Joe Maswanganyi said: “as we speak there
is an amendment bill in parliament which is being assessed by the portfolio
committee on transport”. Maswanganyi was addressing a media briefing on Thursday on
the outcome of the meeting between the Department of Transport, the Meter Taxi
Associations and the E-Hailing Operators which include Uber, Zebra and Taxify.  Maswanganyi said that public hearings on amending the act
are expected to start soon. Read also:  Uber must have permits, say metered-taxi drivers “We cannot predetermine the outcome of the amendment bill
which is before parliament, so there is a willingness on the side of government
to accommodate innovation in this regard. However as we speak the National Land Transport Act No5 of
2009 has to be complied with,” he said. The Minister’s meeting with operators follows an increase in
violence involving both these operators.“Following this meeting and to ensure a safe environment for
both the public and public transport operators, the Law Enforcement Agencies
will continuously monitor all the identified hotspots to prevent acts of
intimidation and violence. “It must be noted that perpetrators of violence and
intimidation will be immediately dealt with in terms of the applicable laws,” Maswanganyi
said. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
